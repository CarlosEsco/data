    "en": "Tokano Yuuka has been going out with her boyfriend Yazaki Norikazu for a little over a year now but doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to see him every day since he works in a different city as a newspaper reporter. Although they are apart, they love each other and things are going well. Norikazu gets an opportunity to interview Saeki Keito, the lead singer of the most popular band in Japan, Zero Sum Game, because they were good friends in high school. Being a fan of the band, Yuuka gets to tag along. However, Yuuka gets raped by members of the band while Keito distracts Norikazu elsewhere. It seems that Keito is infatuated with Norikazu and wants Yuuka out of the way. After the traumatic event, the relationship between the three becomes extremely complicated."
