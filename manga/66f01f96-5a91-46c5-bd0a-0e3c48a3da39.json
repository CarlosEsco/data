    "en": "When K-books turned 15 years old in 2008, a collection consisting of artbooks, special phone cards and many other products was released, to thank its customers. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePlease read the below notes carefully for the contents of EACH volume.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNote #1: This collection comprises of 2 separate artbooks as in, 1 for the boys and 1 for the girls. The particular names are Boys side and Girls Side and neither of the 2 are likely complete. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNote #2: Boys\u0026#39; side = often ecchi and with some images featuring some nudity. One of the images was lolicon, soo I left it out in accordance with Batoto\u0026#39;s site policy. I mean: you don\u0026#39;t want me to start censoring by drawing on someone\u0026#39;s art, right? The image in question was by Kiyotaka Haimura, if anyone\u0026#39;s extremely curious.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGirls\u0026#39; side = mostly shounen-ai but some of the images are not. Nothing that really qualifies as \u0026quot;mature\u0026quot; for this artbook."
