    "en": "Third ranking of the Killing Names of The Violence World, the Zerozaki Clan is infamous for their indomitable family unity. Each of its members exhibit combat prowess when it comes to saving one of their kin. Kishishiki Zerozaki is one member of the Zerozaki family, utilising a bat covered in nails to brutally murder his targets. He calls his weapon \u0026quot;Seamless Bias (Foolish Praise)\u0026quot;.\r\n\r\nHis next target was supposed to be just like any other target, though he was forced to bring Hitoshiki Zerozaki with him as a learning experience. It was supposed to be a standard mission, but now he faces a problem when he discovers that he has become prey to a formidable tactician and a ruthless berserker."
