    "en": "After her father's death, Faith's guardian, Stone, has been paying for her school fees and living costs without her knowledge. He was always the go-to person to when she had problems... But he is only her guardian. Faith couldn't let him pay for her any longer! So she quits school and begins to work to repay her debt to Stone. Unable to persuade her to change her mind, Stone offers her a proposition... he says, \u0026quot;In return for writing off your debt, will you marry me?\u0026quot; Stone tells Faith that his mother will not hand over her company to him until he is married. A proposal from a man she loves... or is this all just a business deal?"
