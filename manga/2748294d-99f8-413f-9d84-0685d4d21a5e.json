    "en": "Incoming first year Noto Kanazawa has always dreamed about joining the St. Modern Kitakou High School broadcasting committee, but the actual experience is not at all like he hoped it would be. \r\n\r\nThe club is run by a group of students who abuse their positions and force one of the first year students, Rinko Tsugaru, to do all their work. Having enough, third year Suzuka Akafuku leaves the club along with Noto and several others to start a new broadcasting club. \r\n\r\nStarting fresh in the old, haunted club room, they must rebuild the club from scratch and overcome opposition from the old club members, not to mention competition from all the nearby schools.\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nAdvance! Kitakou Broadcasting Club PURE is a webmanga by Hidekaz Himaruya that is a retelling of his first manga Advance! Kitakou Broadcasting Club.\r\n\r\nThe comic focuses on a group of students in the broadcasting club at St. Modern Kitakou High School who, tired of mistreatment by the senior members of the group, splinter off to create a new club. Like in the previous version, the main character is Noto Kanazawa, though the development of his character diverges sharply from his first incarnation as he suffers a breakdown and personality changes halfway through the story, coinciding with the debut of the spinoff Barjona Bombers."
