    "en": "Self-centred Nakanda Toyohiro (commonly known as Nakamura because he thinks it is too hard for others to pronounce his name) hates troublesome matters and is not interested in others. To return a favor to Izaki, he was forced to teach in her school for 1 year. He had wanted to get by easily but a series of troublesome events get in his way. Thus his teaching life unfolds."
