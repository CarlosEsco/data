    "en": "Contains 3 stories:\r\n\r\n1) Quartet Game\r\nIn order to welcome the visit of a famous violinist alumnus, Emi, Rui, Takasumi and Taeko were picked by the principal to form a string quartet ensemble for the welcoming concert. In the beginning, the four could hardly play together and often quarreled, for each of them was very talented and had different opinions over the music to be performed. However, during a practice session, they broke a bust statue accidentally and found an ancient sheet music hidden inside the statue, probably handwritten by the composer himself. Fearing to be punished, they didn't tell anyone about the manuscript and began investigation themselves. With a shared secret and a common goal, their relationships quickly improved. They didn't know, however, that the welcome concert was held with a secret purpose.\r\n\r\n2) Another Day\r\nA girl who can time travel finds herself stuck in the past with two boys who are willing to help.\r\n\r\n3) Heart Beat\r\nA boy is in love with his classmate, but a certain professor keeps getting in the way."
