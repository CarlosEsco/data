    "en": "Eunki\u0026rsquo;s always been an introvert, but he was never this jaded before. All the vivid excitement he felt as a freshman moving to the big city has faded into colorless lethargy years later. Now he mostly keeps to himself, only showing his face at the occasional meet-up. But at one such event, he runs into Jungwoo, a peppy young freshman who\u0026rsquo;s keen to make a good impression. Little does Eunki know that this eager hoobae is about to sweep through his stale life like a breath of fresh air.\r\nFrom the creators of \u0026ldquo;Love or Hate\u0026rdquo; comes the new and improved retelling of a fan favorite. These boys have never looked so good."
