    "en": "In the near future, substitute energy called \u0026lsquo;Apo-lithium\u0026rsquo; becomes the most used power source. It has become so widely used that it is in medicinal supplies, high-tech materials, energy industries, narcotics. Apo-lithium has grown to such a level where it is more expensive than gold. However, some have tried to extort this material by means such as committing crimes. With cartels rising into power by acquiring apolithium, the government, economy, the judicial system, and even the police force have been wrought with corruption. The conglomerate, SKY CASETONE, has suggested a method of combatting these cartels, which the government has adopted: an AI-constructed android system called I.T.S.(Instant Trial System).\r\n\r\nA suspended detective, Suh Woo Jin, and his team infiltrate one of the cartel organizations. While investigating, his colleague gets caught and is later saved by Woo Jin; although saving his friend, authorities say that the mission failed because of Woo Jin and is awaiting punishment. With one exception, the authorities give Woo Jin another chance: have Woo Jin in charge as the navigator that creates the \u0026lsquo;Magnum\u0026rsquo; series androids. By doing so, authorities promise he will keep his job. Woo Jin takes the job and begins his investigations on the cartels. Right from the start, a preexisting ITS collision occurs\u0026hellip; a story between an android system and a human prosecutor."
