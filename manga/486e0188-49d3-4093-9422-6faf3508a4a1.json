    "en": "From doing so many hammer sessions at Hikari Gakuen, the first class swindler, Hachisuka Gorou (Fake) and the middle aged yakuza, Imamura have been recaptured... However, a half year later, these two obstinate people succeeded in once again escaping from prison. Even as fugitives, these two don't stop with their mindblowing lessons. This time however, to protect one of their Yakuza friends, the two have been sent into a prison as police informants. But, the place has turned out to be far more sinister than what they could have ever imagined in their minds...\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a half-light novel-half-manga series."
