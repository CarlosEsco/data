    "en": "From Peach Kyoudai:\r\n\r\nKou, who was supposed to be a very ordinary businessman, unexpectedly had a pair of dog ears and a tail appearing on him all of a sudden. \u0026ldquo;What the heck is this?! A special constitution?!!\u0026rdquo; The perplexed Kou immediately turned to his senpai, Okitsu Miyabi, whom he has loved since his school days, for help.\r\n\r\nMiyabi-san is an exceptionally gorgeous person and he always seems to be looking somewhere far away (it seems he really can see something) with his beautiful eyes. He now runs a cafe he inherited from his grandfather. Even though Kou has been visiting the shop every day, Miyabi-san is still as indifferent as he was in the past. However, he seems to be very fond of Kou's ears and tail\u0026hellip;?"
