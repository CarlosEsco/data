   "en": "A poor baron's daughter lived under her sister’s shadow, where nothing was for her. Her hair is full of tangles, she doesn’t have a single dress, and all she has are tattered clothes for work. Her sister got the attention of a high rich noble but died on the way to her marriage. Marie was sent as a substitute bride for her sister, because their father couldn’t repay the already-sold dowry to the earl. But… that’s impossible? In the first place, the proposal was a misunderstanding?\n\nA beautiful and happy story of love about a fallen baron’s daughter and an eloquent earl.\n\n---\nWith unmaintained red hair and shabby clothes, Marie, the baron's daughter, has been treated like a servant all her life. Count Granado, the country's richest man, who is said to be a difficult misogynist, falls in love with her at first sight. However, due to a misunderstanding, Count Granado proposes to her sister Anastasia, who looks like a princess, instead of the ragged Marie. A very popular work from \"Become a Novelist\"! Marie's Cinderella story that began with a hero's misunderstanding!\n\n---\n* [Original Manga](https://seiga.nicovideo.jp/comic/49598)\n* [Original Webtoon](https://comico.jp/comic/7600)\n* [Official English](https://pocketcomics.com/comic/7600?languageCode=en)"
