She was bullied by them everyday. Trash was piled on her desk, and her pencil case was filled with thumbtacks. Kunieda even has to eat lunch in the girls' bathroom to avoid being harassed. Among the classmates who didn't bully or mock her, there is a guy who cares a lot about her. He helps her through the crisis, as well as invites her to eat at his usual table.  \n  \n- Doki-Doki  \nShe boldly confessed to him in the middle of the class! In the upcoming camping trip, she hopes love will blossom between her and her crush, but how can they keep prying eyes away and overcome their akwardness as \"boyfriend and girlfriend\"?  \n  \n- Wish on the Stars  \n  \n- To Hold Your Hand"
