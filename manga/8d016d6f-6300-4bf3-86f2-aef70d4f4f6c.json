   "en": "Under the Air is a one-shot compilation featuring works written and illustrated by Tezuka between 1971 and 1972, and is very highly regarded in Japan. \n\nBelonging to the most mature Tezuka's period, it touches many genres: from pure science fiction to the Nazi era. We find stories of spying, lawsuits against animal testing as far as stories about the more complex dynamics of the human mind.\n  \nAnd the human mind is the leitmotif of the entire volume, namely the duality present in every one of us, and then, mercy, love, understanding, living with the cruelty and violence until something happen in our mind and we discover a side of us unknown to ourselves … and we are not always adequately prepared to regains …  \n  \nNote: Ch.1 and 13 also published in [Clockwork Apple](https://mangadex.org/manga/407/clockwork-apple)."
