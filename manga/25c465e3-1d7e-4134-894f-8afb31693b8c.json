    "en": "Shaymin is a peaceful Gratitude Pok\u0026eacute;mon, lives happily in forests and fields of flowers. But one day Shaymin is accidentally drawn into a battle between the Legendary Pok\u0026eacute;mon Giratina and Dialga. Whisked away far from home, Shaymin is found by Ash, Dawn and Brock, who soon discover that this new Pok\u0026eacute;mon is full of surprises! Of course Team Rocket wants to get their hands on Shaymin, and so does a mysterious man named Zero. Even Giratina is in hot pursuit of this little Pok\u0026eacute;mon--and just what do Giratina and Shaymin have to do with the dimension known as the Reverse World?"
