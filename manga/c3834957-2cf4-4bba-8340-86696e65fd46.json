   "en": "He’s going to be my husband? Princess Brit is forced to marry to preserve the royal bloodline, so she flees the palace and heads for the distant North Sea. But on the way there, her plane crashes, and she is thrown against the steep cliffs. She’s hurt and terrified! As if in answer to her pleas for help, a dark shadow appears. Is he the legendary black knight? No—it’s Eric Greyfell. He’s as beautiful as a hero from Norse myth, but his heart is as impenetrable as a stone statue. And he’s the man she was expected to marry!"
