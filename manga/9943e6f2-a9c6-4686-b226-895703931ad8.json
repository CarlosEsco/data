He wants to have both his fiancee and \u0026quot;pig mouth\u0026quot; at the same time, but this causes \u0026quot;B\u0026quot; to fall into an abyss of pain. Caught in this sad three person relationship, will \u0026quot;A's\u0026quot; final decision shock everyone?!\r\n\r\nCh05-07: IT\r\nA free-spirited and flamboyant high-school surfer, Yuuto, is best friends and best enemies with his 'second-in-command' Iusagi. Together with Aminato and Satori, they form a tight, happy-go-lucky clique. Well, until Yuuto discovers, to his bewilderment, that not only is Iusagi gay, but that Iusagi is into HIM! Of course, all it takes is a little encouragement from Iusagi, and timely interfering from the other two nosy sidekicks for Yuuto to see the 'light'. ^.^"
