    "en": "Kawase Takashi has discovered that he will be learning about caring for animals from the legendary Haruo Minami. It's rumored that she's able to converse with animals, and they tend to all flock around her eagerly. However, she's also very unconventional and more than a little strange. For instance, she dreams of one day ruling a country full just of animals. Will Kawase be able to learn anything useful from such an odd teacher?"
