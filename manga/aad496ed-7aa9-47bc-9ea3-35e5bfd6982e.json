   "en": "Mikage Tarou is a poor 25-year-old writer with a secret: He’s the ghost writer behind an author that has recently become wildly popular, Nagareboshi Ryuusei. Since Tarou’s ghost writing is strictly confidential, everyone he knows believes that he’s something of a failure. His personal life doesn’t make him look very successful either, as he didn’t acquire a very prestigious education and he’s never slept with a woman. His publishing company doesn’t treat him with much respect, and he’s always behind on his apartment rent. His personal life is looking more interesting lately, though. He has a thing for his landlord, an innocent and pretty young woman named Mabayu, and his sexy, uninhibited neighbor Hikaru keeps causing all sorts of awkward situations. Will Mikage ever be able to attain any kind of public success, and will he ever end up with Mabayu?"
