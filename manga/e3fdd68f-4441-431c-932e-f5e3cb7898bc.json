    "en": "While handing out flyers in the park for an art exhibit, Hideaki Kaoru meets a tall handsome young boy. The young boy, Kitamura Shin, immediately asks Kaoru to be his boyfriend. Kaoru refuses; he claims he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a relationship with someone younger than him especially a high schooler because they would not have anything in common and lack maturity. Kaoru further states he isn\u0026rsquo;t interest in males.\r\n\r\nHowever, once Kaoru notices a bracelet that Shin wears which Shin claims is very important to him and from an unrequited love; Kaoru can\u0026rsquo;t help but become agitated with himself for being jealous of Shin\u0026rsquo;s secret crush. Can Kaoru overcome his prejudices against having a younger lover and develop a mature relationship with Shin?"
