    "en": "Brooding alone in a nearby park, Natsurou\u0026rsquo;s only companions were his regrets and painful memories of love\u0026hellip; until a voice rang out to rouse him from his trance. The owner of the voice was the stranger Tsuyuhiko\u0026mdash;a boy who bore a striking resemblance to his former lover. The intriguing youth took pity on the forlorn Natsurou, and he found himself responding to Tsuyuhiko\u0026rsquo;s coaxing without a fight. Following him home, Natsurou allowed himself to be swept up and drowned in pleasure, taking the stranger\u0026rsquo;s offer to use him as a substitute and embrace him as if he was his former lover.  Though their tryst was only meant to be for a single night, Tsuyuhiko gave him an innocent smile and made a promise to meet again\u0026mdash;Natsurou realized something changed inside him. However, it appears his young paramour has some worrisome tendencies\u0026hellip; A heartbroken civil servant and a soft boy with troubling propensities. This \u0026ldquo;how to love\u0026rdquo; romance will slowly teach them about love and affection."
