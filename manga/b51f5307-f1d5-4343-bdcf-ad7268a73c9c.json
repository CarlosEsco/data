   "en": "Collection of 4 short stories:  \n  \n1) Kanon  \nKanon Matsukura is a high school sophomore. Her name is based on her father's favorite classical \"Kanon\"… One day in school while she was walking down the hallway she hears \"Kanon\" being played. It was her math teacher Azume playing it on the piano awkwardly. Since then, \"Kanon\" keeps playing in Kanon's head. A touching story of a high school girl in love!  \n  \n2) Happy Rain  \nTsubasa can't confess to her basketball player Sugita directly, so she asks his teammate to pass him a present instead. Later, she takes shelter from the rain and runs into Sugita's teammate again. Can fifteen minutes in a waiting shed be enough to change one's course in life?  \n  \n3) Bang!!  \nShinyama sees Daiyumi holding a gun to her head and jumps down the stairs to stop her from committing suicide; but it is only a toy gun… Shinyama hurts his right hand and Daiyumi feels obliged to help him taking lesson notes. What does Shinyama feel towards Daiyumi, is it only pity or is it something else?  \n  \n4) Santa is Coming  \nInaba is always teasing Ayumi about not being able to get a boyfriend. In anger she lashes out that she does in fact have plans to meet a boy the next day; when she is really only baby sitting her nephew. What shall she do when she runs into Inaba taking her nephew to the game center!?"
