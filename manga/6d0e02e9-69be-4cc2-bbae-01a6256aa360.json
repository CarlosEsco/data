   "en": "Sanshiro Higashi , a professional wrestler who returned to Japan after completing three years of overseas warrior training , retired because his affiliated group, Shinto Pro, was disbanded during that time, and worked as a manager at a family restaurant.\n\nTwo years later. Sanshiro's ex-colleague, wrestler Shin Gozu, appears at Sanshiro's shop . After breaking both of his knees and being fired from the organization he founded, FTO (unrelated to the real professional wrestling organization Pro Wrestling FTO ), he decided to start a new organization and became its ace. She came to beg Sanshirō for his return. But Sanshirō stubbornly refused to shake his head.\n\nLater, Sanshiro becomes concerned about the Gozu, goes to Korakuen Hall to watch the \"Dream Team\" launch match, and sees the Gozu's helpless appearance.\n\nShinto Pro, which was once a major power, collapsed, and the Japanese professional wrestling world entered the Warring States period with 16 groups. Among them, FTO, led by Gozu, who was No. 1 in terms of popularity and ability, was steadily increasing the number of customers. Pro wrestling is a show that deceives children,\" and the five heads also argued, \"Pro wrestling can be enjoyed by both adults and children,\" and did not yield to each other's claims. In this way, a one-on-one battle of the generational struggle was performed, and the five heads were devastated in front of Akagi and suffered a complete defeat with 5 losses and 5 losses, and both knees were broken.\n\nSanshiro's heart is shaken by Akagi's remarks that deny their professional wrestling, and the \"fighting spirit\" ignites. Sanshirō, who prides himself on being the strongest, shows his will to return.\n\nA new fighting spirit legend of the strongest professional wrestler Higashi Sanshiro was about to begin."
