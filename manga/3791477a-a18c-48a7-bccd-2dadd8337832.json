    "en": "Kojima Hiromichi is the ace batter of the Lycaons - a notoriously weak baseball team that is often ranked at the bottom of the league. Determined to lead the team to victory prior to his retirement, Kojima takes a trip to a training camp in Okinawa, hoping to discover what factors the Lycaons lack.\r\nHere, he happens upon a game dubbed \"One Outs\" - a gambling derivative of baseball - and is soundly defeated by a blond pitcher named Tokuchi Toua, who is claimed to have never allowed a hit in any of the 499 games he has played.\r\nKojima realizes that he has found the 'missing factor' and makes a wager with Tokuchi.\r\nLittle does anyone know that the outcome of this gamble will dictate the fates of the Lycaons and all those connected to the team."
