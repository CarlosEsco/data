    "en": "MU: The first story is by Ogura Muku sensei, and the latter is by Kobato Mebaru sensei.\r\n\r\n1. Bear-kun is always laughed at for being so clumsy and useless, despite his large size. So, he has come to hate the fact that he is large. Squirrel-kun finds him crying, and one thing leads to another and Bear-kun ends up helping Squirrel-kun using his large size.\r\n\r\n2. The eldest brother in the wolf family is actually a fox... a golden fox. He knows he's \u0026quot;different\u0026quot; from all the rest. One day, he falls in the swamp and gets covered in mud... as a result, he is black like his brothers. When the second eldest brother sees this, he begins licking the fox to expose the beautiful fur. Together they discover the pleasure their tails can bring."
