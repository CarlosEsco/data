   "en": "One day a boy named Pete finds a map of \"Treasure Island\" that his deceased father left behind. He starts on a voyage to find it together with \"Captain,\" who was a friend of his father. But his ship is attacked by pirates, led by Bowarl, and the two are caught. When a storm hits the pirate ship, the two are thrown into the sea and washed up on the shore of a solitary island in the southern ocean. To their surprise, this island is the one they have been looking for…  \n  \nThe manga that made Tezuka famous. It is an action-adventure drama inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's book.\n\nThis is the redone version for the Tezuka 400 Complete Works.\n\nWhen time came to collect NTI for the Complete Works, Tezuka had promised that *All* of his works would get collected, but the original version was presumed lost. \n\nTezuka, wishing to keep on his promise, decided to redraw the entire manga from memory. The version restored characters previously cut (like Peter Pan). The original ending was also restored, making this the definitive version of *New Treasure Island*.\n\nAmong other alterations, this 1984 version is a 4Koma manga whereas the original was a mix of 2/3Koma.\n\n[Official English](https://emanga.com/collections/osamu-tezuka/products/new-treasure-island)\n\n---\n**Volume 281 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
