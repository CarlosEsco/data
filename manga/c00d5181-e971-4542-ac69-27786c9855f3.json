   "en": "Takuya and Rika are co-workers for a travel agency and have barely ever interacted as they are both introverted, anti-social people. Both are doing their jobs as normal when an announcement from the higher-ups comes down: in one year, an overseas branch will be opening in Siberia, and an employee from their location will be sent to work there! While there's no telling who will be chosen to go, it is explained that people who are married and have families are far less likely to be sent! Neither Takuya nor Rika want to go to Siberia! Desperate to protect their solitary lives, they develop a plan: pretend that they are getting married to each other! Will they be able to keep up this charade for 365 days, and, maybe, even fall for one another in that time?\n\n**Live action series adaptation**: [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/734823-kekkon-surutte-hontou-desu-ka)",
