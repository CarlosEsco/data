    "en": "Haruhi's sick of being bossed around by his younger stepbrother, Akito, and tells him he's had enough. Haruhi's too nice, though. Upon seeing Akito's sad expression, he tries to console his brother, only for Akito to kiss him right then and there! Haruhi's never seen Akito so desperate. Akito doesn't hate him!? ...But, why show it with a kiss!? Akito's behavior escalates, and Haruhi's still not sure what's going on in his brother's head. This is a romantic comedy about two stepbrothers in a taboo relationship. One's besotted yet stand-offish, and the other's entirely at his mercy!"
