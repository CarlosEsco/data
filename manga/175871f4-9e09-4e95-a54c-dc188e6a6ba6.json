But what's this? Mai might have more then just sisterly feelings for her brother?\r\nAnd why is Majyu's heart starting to hurt so much when she sees them together, when she shouldn't care in the first place?\r\nAn uncomplicated story about jealousy, obsession, forbidden love, and a little courage about ones feelings.\r\n\r\n- Line Heart\r\nMafuyu has always looked after Yuna, even now when they're both in high school.
