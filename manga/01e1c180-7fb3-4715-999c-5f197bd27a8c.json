   "en": "“Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve been infatuated with the “other side”; the world of splendor. Yes, I wanted to become one of those glittering stars. And so, my dream has come true. But now…All I want is to be beloved by someone.”  \n  \nWhen she was young, Yukino Miyashita wanted, more than anything else to become an idol. After accomplishing her dream, however, the idol group she was part of failed to sell, and she returned to school, facing alienation from her peers. Now, at age 18, Yukino is living alone in Tokyo, half-heartedly trying to start a new life as a talent manager, while not quite able to put her idol days behind her. She meets Setsuko, a songwriter who also once belonged to a failed idol group. The romance sparked by her encounter with Setsuko causes Yukino to reevaluate her own life."
