Will Ayase ever get to be in a real relationship with him?\r\n\r\n2)Be Careful After School- Madoka is president of the art committee and a sadistic witch.

After a particular bad episode Miwa decides to date Asako (who's not exactly willing). Secretly she's always had feelings for him, but she knows it won't be long before he strays. But her biggest rival is...a dog?!\r\n\r\n4)Dangerous Love Triangle- Chijiru has a crush on her classmate Maki, but he won't give her the time of day. When she sees a young boy being molested in the park she defends him, only to find out the \"young boy\" is Maki's older brother, Nakajou, a devil with an angel's face!
