    "en": "Tori knows he's unlucky, and that's why he lives humbly and quietly without friends. The only things that make him happy are games, social media, and Hiro, his big brother-like childhood friend. One day, Ryoma, a good-looking, happy-go-lucky guy, transfers into Tori's class. He's so different that he frustrates Tori, who decides to just ignore him, but Ryoma approaches Tori anyway. This is the story of a super unlucky guy and his lucky classmate in pursuit of their happily ever after!"
