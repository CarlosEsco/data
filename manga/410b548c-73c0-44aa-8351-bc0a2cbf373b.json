    "en": "Legends tell of a race of divine beings known as Seraphim, whose unseen  influence is felt throughout the world. Those with the ability to  commune with the Seraphim became known as \u0026ldquo;Shepherds\u0026rdquo;, the most  pure-hearted of which could even be granted a Seraphim\u0026rsquo;s power. While some would praise these empowered Shepherds as living paragons, others would fear their strength and call them demons. Sorey  is a young human who has spent his entire life in The Divine Forest, a  holy place where he lives in harmony with many Seraphim. Enraptured by  the legends within an ancient tome, he makes daily excursions into a  nearby ruin in the hope of learning more about the Seraphim and their history, along with his Seraphim childhood friend Mikleo. One day, he is trapped by a cave-in alongside his friend and a young knight  named Alisha, who is investigating a series of natural disasters that  have been plaguing the world. When Sorey discovers that the Seraphim may  be involved, he resolves to leave his home alongside Alisha and find  the truth."
