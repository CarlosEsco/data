   "en": "Shirley, for the most part, follows a young maid named Shirley who finds a job as a live in maid with a cafe owner. There are several somewhat related short stories.  \n  \nYet another maid-tastic manga from Kaoru Mori, \"Shirley\" is an evocative glimpse into the daily life of winsome, 13-year-old Shirley, a maid in turn-of-the-century England.  \n  \nIt has no connection with the other maid story of the author, also Emma is a Victorian Maid, but Shirley is a Edwardian Maid.  \n  \nVolume 1 includes two other short stories:  \n1. An Afternoon with Nelly and Me  \n2. Mary Banks  \n\"Mary Banks\" tells about a maid with a Master who loved playing pranks on his servants. Frogs, spraying them with water, trip ropes and other forms of foolishness were all she could look forward to any day. But when her employer passes away unexpectedly, what will happen to Mary Banks?  \n  \nShirley or Shirley Medison/Madison?  \nShirley and the oneshots in volume 1 were first published as doujinshi around 2000-2001, at that time the title was \"Shirley Medison\". In 2003 the first volume was released by Enterbrain publisher as just \"Shirley\", CMX later translated her name as \"Shirley Madison\". In 2006, the author decided to continue her work with Shirley and released two chapters under the title \"Shirley Medison\", these were followed by 2 more in 2010, then another 2 in 2013 and again 2 in 2014. Finally in 2014 all previous \"Shirley Medison\" chapters were released in \"Shirley\" volume 2. In 2018, a new chapter of \"Shirley Medison\" was released in a magazine.  \n  \nIn Japan, all magazine chapters are listed under \"Shirley Medison\", and when collected into tankobon volumes, they're labeled simply \"Shirley\"."
