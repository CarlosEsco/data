    "en": "Odd at War is a fantasy/action manga that follows the story of Kehl. A young boy who was introduced to the truth of the world he lives in, in the worst way possible. After being rescued by a mysterious figure while his village was being raided by mercenaries, he comes into contact with a whole new world. A world of violence and fear. As he discovers who is to blame for the death of his loved ones aswell as his way of living, Kehl sets his goal of revenge. However, not everything is as straight forward as it seems, as he'll learn that he possesses an unknown form of supernatural power that forms a link between him and those he despises the most."
