   "en": "A Collection of Oneshots.  \n  \n- Sentimental  \n  \n- Kimi Shika Mienai  \n  \n- BlackxBlack  \nMayuka Fujisawa is lonely. Having lost her parents in a car accident several years ago, she's lived her life alone; she has no friends by her side, and no one she loves. However, one day, Mayuka returns home from school and finds a beautiful man collapsed in her yard - his name is Marshall, and he's a demon who fell from the sky. His red stone pendant is missing along with his wings, and thus he begrudgingly stays with Mayuka for the purpose of home-cooked meals and a place to stay until he can find his stone. Mayuka loves spending time with Marshall and is happy to not be alone again, but she also knows he wants to return to the sky…  \n  \n- Tokenai Yuki  \n  \n- Black x Black - Bangai Hen\n"
