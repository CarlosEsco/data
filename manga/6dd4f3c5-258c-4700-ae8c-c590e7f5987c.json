    "en": "From [url=https://thelazylittlepeach.home.blog/]Peach Kyoudai[/url]:\r\n\r\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re going to choose a guy, why can\u0026rsquo;t it be me?\u0026rdquo;\r\n\r\nMinami, a gay fortune teller, has had a crush on his schoolmate, Kitahara, since high school. Kitahara, who has been divorced three times, asked to stay over at his house for a while, and so they started living together. Minami was convinced that Kitahara would never fall in love with him, but the new \u0026quot;crush\u0026quot; Kitahara found was, surprisingly, a man. Taken over by his feelings, Minami ended up kissing Kitahara!?\r\n\r\nThis is a clumsy and endearing unrequited love that sways between friendship and love."
