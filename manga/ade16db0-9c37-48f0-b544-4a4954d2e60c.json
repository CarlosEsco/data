    "en": "Synopsis (MTL):\r\nVance, the guardian knight of the female emperor of the Celestial Empire, one of the Seven Empires, swore to be the Emperor guard in the next life as well, and ended his first life by performing the Reincarnation Ceremony with his sovereign, who died in order to end the war.\r\n\r\nA thousand years later, after the war has died down, Vance is reborn in a world where he and Lloyd have been reincarnated. Vance is reincarnated and named Lloyd, and he is adopted by the Count family of the Celestial Empire and raised by them.\r\n\r\nWhen he turns fifteen, Lloyd decides to enter a magical academy where students from all over the world gather to search for his master, who should have been reincarnated just like him.\r\n\r\n「Let's see how well you can work with the level of magic you can handle as an escort,」\r\n\r\nHe thought that if he joined the Academy of Magic, there would be many better wizards than him, but as the Celestial Emperor's bodyguard, he was also well versed in the martial arts and all kinds of magic, and in some cases even more powerful than the Celestial Emperor.\r\nThe bodyguard, who has surpassed humanity and stepped into the realm of the gods, begins his life at the school in order to find the person he wants to protect, and this time, protect her until the end."
