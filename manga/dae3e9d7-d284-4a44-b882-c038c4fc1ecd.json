   "en": "It is said that he who wears the No. 1 headband shall rule the world. It is also said that only he who wears the No. 2 headband may challenge the No. 1.  \n  \nYears ago, a swordsman who wore the No.1 was brutally slain by a power hungry gunman named Justice. The swordsman's son witnessed the murder, and has grown up to become the cold-hearted warrior Afro Samurai. Afro has honed his skills with a single purpose in mind.  \n  \nWith the No. 2 band around his forehead, Afro sets out to give Justice his due. But with scores of assassins and two-bit warriors eager to kill the No. 2 and take his place as top contender, will he survive long enough to avenge his father's death?  \n  \nSee [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5275) for the anime.  \nSee [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10181) for the anime (movie sequel)  \nSee [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6718) for the live-action movie."
