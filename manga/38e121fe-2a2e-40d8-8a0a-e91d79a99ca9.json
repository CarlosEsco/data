   "en": "Before Arakawa Hiromu became a mangaka, she spent seven years in Hokkaido working in the farming business. She raised cows, planted crops, was afraid of bears, and was constantly being turned around in circles by squirrels. There is no water to drink. Can’t you drink milk? That is because she is a “Noble Farmer”!! Here is Japan’s first manga to describe the facts about farming!"

     "en": "Hiromu Arakawa (荒川 弘, Arakawa Hiromu, born May 8, 1973) is a Japanese manga artist. She is best known for the manga series Fullmetal Alchemist (2001–2010), which became a hit both domestically and internationally, and was adapted into two anime television series. She is also known for Silver Spoon (2011–2019) and the manga adaptation of The Heroic Legend of Arslan novels.\n\nArakawa states that Suihō Tagawa, the author of Norakuro, is the \"root of [her] style as an artist\". She also learned composition and drawing during her time as assistant of Hiroyuki Etō [ja]. She also cites Rumiko Takahashi, Shigeru Mizuki, and Kinnikuman by Yudetamago as influences and is a fan of Mike Mignola's work. Reviewers consider Fullmetal Alchemist to have steampunk influences.\n\n\u003eWhen the neighbor's little girl (three years old) knew I was a manga artist, I heard that she asked with expectant eyes, \"do you draw a  beautiful princess?\" I said, \"little girl, I'm sorry. What I draw are ugly men.\"\n\n —Arakawa Hiromu\n-\n---\nHer real name is ARAKAWA Hiromi (荒川 弘美)\n\nHer self-portrait is usually that of a bespectacled cow, as she was born and raised on a dairy farm in Hokkaido with three older sisters and a younger brother. She worked as a farmer for 8 years before moving to Tokyo.\n\nArakawa started out as ETO Hiroyuki's assistant writer for Mahōjin Guru Guru and a friend of Shakugan no Shana author TAKAHASHI Yashichirou.\n\nArakawa's career started with a work titled STRAY DOG, but she is best known for creating the Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nFriends with SEGAMI Akira.\n\nArakawa-san gave birth to a son in 2007.\n\nMIYOSHI Hikaru, TSUBOTA Noriko, TAKAEDA Keisui, YUZUKA Masanari, SHISHIDO Michiko, HINODEYA Sankichi, TOKO Jun, SUZUKI Manatsu and AIYAH-BALL were her assistants in Hagane no Renkinjutsushi.\nINARIYA Fusanosuke was possibly another assistant of hers.\n\nShe received the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Award (New Artist Prize) 2011 for Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nThe Shinsei Prize was also awarded to Arakawa.
