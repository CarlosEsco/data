Can Shinji really handle the truth behind Haruki's unusually selfish actions? Will he give up on Haruki altogether?\r\n\r\n4-5.5: Piano Lesson\r\nAfter his parents' divorce, Hara Shuuji left Tokyo to live with his mother and attend the local school.

Shuuji's first impression of Yoshie isn't good, but what's worse is that his ideals for a peaceful school life are ruined when Yoshie suddenly recognizes him! Shuuji, a new student, has no idea how Yoshie can possibly know him and he frantically wonders: what in the world is going on!?\r\n\r\n[b][u]Polish / Polski:[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]Zbi\u0026oacute;r one-shot\u0026oacute;w. \r\nch1-2: Naoto i Hajime przyjaźnią się od dziecka.
