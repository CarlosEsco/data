    "en": "Shinesman is a comedy series that parodies shows like Power Rangers or Ronin Warriors. There were only ever two episodes released, with notably hilarious dubbing for a show. The manga series has 9 volumes and is drawn by Kaimu Tachibana, who often draws BL, so you can expect there to be innuendo or jokes about the male characters being too close.\r\n\r\nThe main story in Shinesman is that Matsumoto has joined the Right Trading Company, and somehow was picked to become the newest member of a group of superheroes called \u0026quot;Shinesman\u0026quot; (which would sound like \u0026quot;Businessmen\u0026quot; in English). They fight evil aliens who are trying to take over the business world. It's light-hearted and undeniably cute."
