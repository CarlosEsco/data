    "en": "Hae-Gyeong has a horrible dream in which he meets a terrible group who are killing him saying; \u0026quot;'Boss star' Hae-Deung, the head of Hyeon-Mu! We are here receive your life. Only the universe may know what will be there at the end of this way! Anyhow, you have to die here and now!\u0026quot;\r\n\r\nAt the offset, it seems that Hae-Gyeong is a very ordinary highschool boy. However, the truth is murkier than even he himself knows... Originally Hae-Gyeong was Hae-Deung, King Hyeon-Mu, in the fantasy world, but his power had been sealed through the veiled enmity caused by his entanglement in the Daegyeolgye causing him to be born into the present world.\r\n\r\nHae-Gyeong is shocked and disbelieving when he hears about this truth from his best friend, Wun-Hak. What is worse, Kin Ju-Jak, suddenly appears and attacks Hae-Gyeong, who has not yet awakened, and he is narrowly rescued by Kin Cheong-Ryong who claims to be his ally.\r\n\r\nAs he gains a better understanding of his previous life, Hae-Gyeong awakens his powers gradually. How is it going to end?"
