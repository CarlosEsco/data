    "en": "Thirteen years ago, an unidentified wall of light suddenly appeared around Sumihama. In order to return to his hometown, which had been cut off from the outside world since that day, Gataka Oro (24 years old) crossed the wall. At that moment, he was engulfed by a blinding light, and when he woke up, he found himself in the body of a child. Furthermore, his estranged childhood friend, Hime, appears before him just as she was back then. His body and her appearance, a nostalgic scenery, familiar places... Is this the world thirteen years ago?"
