   "en": "Ikeya is good at his job, his colleagues look up to him, and he can always be relied upon. He just has one wish: for a guy to top him. He plays with himself every night and is desperate for the real thing, but unfortunately, he's a scary-looking alpha, making it almost impossible to find a partner. One day, Yuuhei Shimamori, who happens to be an omega, starts work at Ikeya's company. He may look like a carefree playboy, but his diligence soon catches Ikeya's attention. However, when the two of them are alone in the office one night, Yuuhei goes into heat! Pheromones overflowing, he tells Ikeya that he needs an alpha, or his symtoms won't stop… Ikeya can hardly control himself, and at his limit, asks Yuuhei to top him!"
