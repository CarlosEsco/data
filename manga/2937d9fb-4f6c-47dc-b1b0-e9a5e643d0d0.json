Furthermore, \"oh\" can mean king in Japanese, making it possible to read the name as \"the great king\".\n\nCharacteristics of Ito's style include violent plots, the use of English words amidst kanji, and a parade of beautiful female characters.\n\nIn 2006, he received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen for Air Gear. Ito also created the adult series Silky Whip (Official English Title). He also designed some of the alternate character outfits in the PlayStation 2 version of Namco's 3D fighting game Tekken 5, as well as a guest character in Soul Calibur IV named Ashlotte.\n\nOnce applied as Morita Masanori’s assistant when he was a freeter, but didn’t get the job.\n\nNoguchi Koyuri was his assistant in Air Gear while Yashirogawa Takashi was on Tenjou Tenge.\n\nCircle(s): G3.
