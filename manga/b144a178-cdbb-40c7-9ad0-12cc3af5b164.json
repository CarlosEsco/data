    "en": "1: Scent Filled Days\r\n\u0026quot;Stay away from me, you stink.\u0026quot; Hearing these words from high-schooler Kazunari sends auto mechanic Ryosuke into a confused funk. As the son of the garage owner, Kazunari should be used to the smells of oil and sweat, right? But he seems determined to avoid Ryosuke, who's equally determined to find out why!\r\n\r\n2-4: Body Talk Paradox\r\nTattoo artist Shidou is very negative and unsociable. He can't call people close to him friends and he has no lovers. Even when he feels lonely, he only goes for one-night stands. But then Takita, whom Shidou had slept with previously, approaches him without any hesitation! Takita comes to visit him every day at work, and Shidou can't refuse him because he owns the building. Takita's expressions of love for Shidou are escalating day by day!\r\n\r\n5: Love Sensitive\r\nTattoo artists and coworkers Sasame and Kaji are more like mother and child, with the wild looking Kaji taking care of the gloomy Sasame. Kaji's instincts are far from motherly, and he's grown to care for Sasame, whose sensitivity to the cold temperatures are making him more lethargic than usual. Can Kaji think of ways to keep him warmed up?\r\n\r\n6: Mad Synapse\r\nAkimoto just wants to keep everything in his work \u0026quot;moderate\u0026quot; but his co-worker, Suzuki, keep giving him trouble with his airheadedness. And too bad for Suzuki, but Akimoto isn't as nice as he might seem on the outside."
