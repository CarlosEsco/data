    "en": "Some people have been permanently banned from martial arts federations and professional tournaments because they were too powerful, too violent. We call them Flag Fighters. They organize battles at night, the Flag Fights. They put their life on the line, for the winner shall take his opponent's flag, the very symbol of their identity. From these fights, a legend was born: Whoever will collect 1000 flags shall govern the world.\r\n\r\nWe're following Reppa, a young Flag Fighter sporting a spiked dog collar. What's his goal? And why are his opponents seemingly surprised by his special technique?\r\n\r\nThe manga was axed after 20 chapters, so it's pretty open-ended."
