   "en": "*Tezuka completely redrew this from memory for the Tezuka 400 when this version was presumed lost. \nIt was later rediscovered and collected in the Tezuka bunko.*\n\n(from mangaupdates):\n The manga that made Tezuka famous. It is an action-adventure drama inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's book.\n\n One day a boy named Pete finds a map of \"Treasure Island\" that his deceased father left behind. He starts on a voyage to find it together with \"Captain,\" who was a friend of his father. \n\n But his ship is attacked by pirates, led by Bowarl, and the two are caught. When a storm hits the pirate ship, the two are thrown into the sea and washed up on the shore of a solitary island in the southern ocean. To their surprise, this island is the one they have been looking for.\n\n This version was edited by Shichima Sakai who cut many pages, characters, and even the original ending from the final version. Tezuka himself was dismayed by this and, as a result, he does not fully consider the work his own.\n\nWhen time came to collect it for the Complete Works, Tezuka had promised that *All* of his works would get collected, but the original version was presumed lost. \n\nTezuka, wishing to keep on his promise, decided to redraw the entire manga from memory. The version restored characters previously cut (like Peter Pan). The original ending was also restored, making this the definitive version of *New Treasure Island*.\n\nAmong other alterations, the 1984 version is a 4Koma manga whereas the original was  a mix of 2/3Koma."
