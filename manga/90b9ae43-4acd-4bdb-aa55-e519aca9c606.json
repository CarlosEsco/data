    "en": "The modern vibe of hip-hop culture merges with the timeless aesthetic of the 1920's in a brand new webcomic about ambition. Inspired by the unique sound of Japanese electronic-swing rap, HonkyTonk Hustlers tells the story of two men from completely different worlds, taking on the big city and it's music market in the midst of the Great Prohibition of Rap Music in the 1920's era. Set in an alternate universe, the history of our world is irrelevant- however, the musical history of the past manifests itself in it's own ways.\r\n\r\nJin, a hard-working country boy born to overseas immigrants, has known nothing but honesty and dedication his entire life. Raymond, the wealthy heir to a politician, finds himself penniless after a mysterious fire destroys his peaceful existence. The lives of these two men collide in the most electrifying of ways- right in the heart of the big city of Neumoney.\r\n\r\nHAVE YOU EVER DEVOTED YOURSELF TO ANYTHING?\r\nThen follow us."
