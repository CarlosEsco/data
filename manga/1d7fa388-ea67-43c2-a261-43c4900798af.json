    "en": "Shouma Tsuji was on his way home from work when he finds a drunk man plastered all over a garbage heap. Pitying the man\u0026rsquo;s state, he decided to help and brought the man to his home. He lets the man use his shower, and once the stranger is all sober and cleaned up, Shouma\u0026rsquo;s surprised to find that the man he helped was Kakeru Ashida, a school mate from his middle school days. Kakeru was well-known back then, and his gay reputation didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly endear him to his Shouma\u0026rsquo;s peers.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at an adult Kakeru, Shouma is left with mixed feelings. Kakeru reassures him that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t really remember much though he points out that Shouma has a kind nature for taking him in. He also shared that he was drowning his sorrows due to another rejection. Kakeru then takes advantage of Shouma\u0026rsquo;s kindness, which leads to more things than one."
