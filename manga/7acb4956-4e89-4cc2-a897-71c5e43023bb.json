    "en": "Wednesday, September 7, 2011\r\nThe Way Home [Yuu Vol. 10]\r\nSo this is a oneshot from volume 10 of a horror magazine (or \u0026quot;ghostly magazine\u0026quot; as they call it) called Yuu (幽), website here. It contains short stories by various authors (some of which I'm working on translations of to post here), articles about things that are paranormal in some way (in this issue there was an article about the internet trend called ひとりかくれんぼ (or \u0026quot;one man hide and seek\u0026quot; as it's known in the west I think) and a collection of interviews about the dark side of maid cosplay, haha), photographs, \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; stories, and there's an annual literary prize, so in this issue there was a section written by people involved with the judging process with commentary about the entries and what makes a good horror story.\r\n\r\nThere's also a manga section. This issue had four 6-page stories and a 12-page story each by a different mangaka. The one that I chose to translate for today is kind of similar to Fuan no Tane in that it has that urban legend, real-ish feel to it, though slightly longer and with more dialog.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nTwo brothers encounter something strange on their way home from the train station."
