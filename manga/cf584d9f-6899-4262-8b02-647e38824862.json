    "en": "I, Amekawa Shintarou, don\u0026rsquo;t get along with Haruna Natsuki, my childhood friend that lives next to me. When we were younger, we were so close that we promised to marry each other, but I got addicted to an FPS game, and I gradually distanced away from Natsuki. Before long, our relationship ended where we would talk harshly to each other every time we meet.\r\n\r\nOne day, I had to give printouts to Natsuki who left school early, and I got to enter her room for the first time in 5 years.\r\nHowever, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t there, and instead I found an expensive gaming PC.\r\nDisplayed on its screen was the post-battle result of an FPS game I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing for years.\r\nAt that time, I was surprised by her kill count and her username.\r\n\r\nThe player ranked second in the world; [2N]\r\n\r\nNo way\u0026hellip;there\u0026rsquo;s no way\u0026hellip;\r\n\r\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no way that my childhood friend is 2N, the player ranked second in the world stage, the remarkable sniper player, and my best friend!!"
