    "en": "Akira Tsubakiya has spent her whole life being told she looks like a boy. She\u0026rsquo;s super tall, she has a flat chest, and she\u0026rsquo;s not girly at all\u0026hellip; In middle school, she made a promise with a boy who went to her cram school, Haru\u0026mdash; a promise that they both would aim to get into the same high school, a prestigious academy. Haru told Akira that he likes girls with long hair, and since she started to fall for him, she grew it out. Now she\u0026rsquo;s graduating from middle school, and has decided to confess her feelings to Haru. Unfortunately, she finds out that he has a girlfriend\u0026mdash;a super-cute, girly, long-haired girlfriend! Akira runs home and chops off all her hair, deciding that there\u0026rsquo;s no point to trying to be girly.\r\n\r\nFast forward to Akira\u0026rsquo;s first year in high school. She still wears a skirt, but she wears the top half of the guys\u0026rsquo; uniform to school. She\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;Prince Akira\u0026rdquo;, and all the girls are infatuated with her. Akira hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen Haru in a while, but she does bump into Haru\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;girlfriend\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; who she discovers to be in fact a boy!"
