    "en": "1-2: The Mob Men's Melancholy\r\nUniversity student, Ochi Shinobu, refers to himself as a Mob man. He thought he had finally evaded his two high school classmates, Sugano You and Kaitou Keiichi. However, it seems that these two are more than willing to chase after a mob man than become the main characters in their own story. Will Shinobu finally evade these two, or will he become more than just a mob man?\r\n\r\n3-4: I'm Not Much Good At Anything, But Please Be Kind To Me\r\nTwo childhood friends begin to realize that maybe there is more to their relationship than just friendship.\r\n\r\n5: The Secret Story Of With You\r\nA high school student falls in love with the sound of a radio show host's voice. What happens when he meets that host's younger brother, who just so happens to have the exact same voice?"
