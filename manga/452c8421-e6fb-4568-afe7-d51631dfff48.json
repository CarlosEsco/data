    "en": "Contains 2 stories:\r\n\r\n1) Tsuki no Toiki: Ai no Kizu -\r\n\r\nFeudal Japan: a girl is found among the bamboo with a slash wound on her back. Having no memories of her identity she is taken into a local brothel and put in charge of babysitting and housekeeping duties. One day, a frequent handsome customer, who also happens to be the head guard of the local castle, notices and wants her as his partner. Having none of that, the girl whacks him across his face, but he does not give up that easily.\r\n\r\n2) Tsuki no Toiki: Natsu no Yume -\r\n\r\nTo protect Hanzou's homeland from attack by her family, Sara must infiltrate the ninja town of Iga and steal their secret gunpowder formula. As an added bonus, she gets to marry Hanzou in the process. There is just one problem...it's not the Hanzou she thinks it is! And when our lecherous Hanzou from the first story comes around to visit, he gets quite a surprise."
