    "en": "For 12 years, Sakaguchi Hiro has been the secret admirer to a certain girl he met at the church his father gives sermons at. Her name is Tatsumori Ayano, and these two have been going to the same schools from elementary to college, but Hiro has never had the courage to even talk to her, much less ask her out. One night after a failed attempt to actually hold a conversation with the girl of his dreams, an actual angel fell into his room from the heavens. Apparently, this angel has been sent from the heavens to have sex with Hiro! Will he be able to save himself for Ayano or will he fall for the angel who is determined to have his babies?"
