    "en": "After being nicknamed \u0026quot;Yinkyahime/Princess Goth Chick\u0026quot; (陰キャ or Yin character, opposite of Yang) because of her behavior in  elementary school, Komachi Tamamura spent three years as a hikikomori. Since she continued to ditch even after in high school, her sister Chacha sent her Nanado Nado Nado, a friendship android to lead Komachi back to real life interactions in school!\r\n\r\nKomachi gained some friends when she started playing a game app, and eventually returned to school even though reluctant. She has a negative prejudice to many things in the world due to the knowledge she gained on the Internet in her young age. She's not good at studying or playing sports, but is great at tsukkomi.\r\n\r\nNanado's official name is \u0026quot;Code 7D-O\u0026quot;, but she is rarely called that. She is bright and optimistic, and doesn't think too much about things. She can perform general living activities such as talking and eating, just like humans, so that she does not seem to be an android. While she can emit a beam from the eyes and has 100 language modes, she does not have enough arithmetic functions for high school. \r\n\r\n[i][url=https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%AA%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A9%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A9%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A9]Based on MTL ofJapanese Wikipedia page.[/url][/i]"
