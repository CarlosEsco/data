    "en": "Set in the Taish≈ç era, our protagonist of the story is a young boy \u0026mdash; Sakura Mayumi. Mayumi is the revered son of the best doctor in Tokyo. He excels in academics, carries an aura of dignity and to top it all off, is quite the looker. One could say he is the embodiment of the word 'perfection'.\r\nFrom a very young age, he has been brought up to exceed everyone's expectations and as a result he naturally seeks refinement in the environment surrounding him, including the people around him of course. And that is where he refuses to accept Nakamoto Kao as she is! A girl from the countryside hired as a maid, Kao is a total klutz, more or less a mistake-to-happen. Add to Mayumi's irritation, she follows him around calling out to him \u0026quot;Young Master! Young Master!\u0026quot;. If that wasn't enough, she can neither read nor write!\r\nThus Mayumi's struggle to transform Kao into a maid worthy of the Sakura household begins!"
