    "en": "\u0026quot;Baren\u0026quot; is the name of a gathering of writers of tanka, a form of Japanese short poetry. Under the impression he's going on a date with his crush, Maiko, 19-year-old Kunitomo Katsuo finds himself pulled into the group.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, Katsuo's first tanka is well-received, especially by the popular published tanka poet Iga Kansuke, who also happens to be Maiko's lover. Katsuo and Kansuke couldn't be more different; Kansuke is jaded, cruel, and sophisticated, while Katsuo is a modest, friendly virgin. Kansuke, darkly obsessed with his innocent young rival, takes Katsuo under his wing. Will Katsuo be able to retain both his skill with words and his good-natured heart as he gets pulled deeper into the drama of the tanka community?"
