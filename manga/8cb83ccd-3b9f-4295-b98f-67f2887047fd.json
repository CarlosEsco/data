But Soichiro gets a second chance when he wakes up two days before his accident....\r\n\r\n[*] Iku Michi, Yobu Tsuki \r\nOtsuji cuts through a dangerous park one night. He's attacked by hoodlums and thrown into a lake. There he meets the demon of the lake--and can't leave.\r\n\r\n[*] Moment \r\nAtsushi slowly recovers after being dumped by his ex-lover. His sister and brother-in-law, worried he's becoming a recluse, invite him out for a drink at their bar. While at the bar he is smitten by Kizaki, a beautiful college student. Before he approaches his crush, Atsushi gets a makeover from his sister (his fashion sense is deplorable). Things go much better than he expected. But, after their tryst, Atsushi has to work overtime for a week. When he finally makes it back to the bar, he sees Kizaki kissing someone else. Will Atsushi be forced to give up on his dream of love? \r\n\r\n[*] Hana mo Arashi mo\r\nThe florist Nagasaki Kouta is 25 years old, but has the body of a child. He has known the 10 year younger Nagira Takerou since \u0026quot;Ta-kun\u0026quot; was a small child who always clung to him; but now the 15 year old boy always insults him and treats him harshly. What has happened to make Ta-kun dislike him so much?\r\n\r\n[*] Mayonaka Taiyou (Midnight Sun) \r\nKakeru, Shouichi-san, and little Rurika are back in a sequel to Hohoemi no Nichijou.
