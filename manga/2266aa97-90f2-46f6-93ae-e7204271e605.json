    "en": "Soumatou Kabushikigaisha is a company that offers a very peculiar service. Customers, after giving their name and birthdate, are led to a room with a single television. A woman then brings them a DVD that they may watch as they desire. This DVD is the record of their entire life, from birth to the present moment. These customers may gain new insight into the events of their lives, and discover truths about the people they encounter that they might never have guessed. The first customer is 43-year-old Sugiura Katsumi, whose daughter and wife have died relatively recently. In reviewing his life, all the happiness, sadness, and terrible mistakes come back to him, and the cause of the series of recent tragic events in his life will become painfully clear. \u0026ensp;(From: tethysdust)"
