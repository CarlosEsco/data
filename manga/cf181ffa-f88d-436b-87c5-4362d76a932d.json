    "en": "Alex has a lot of respect and admiration for his cousin Diwa. This is because he is his guardian while he is studying in Manila.\r\n\r\nDuring Alex's temporary work at the library as an OJT, he met librarian Yal Ogana.\r\n\r\nHis Kuya Diwa is strict but kind.\r\n\r\nYal is stern and rude.\r\n\r\nWhile Alex is with his Kuya Diwa and Yal, he can't help but notice that there is something strange between the two. It's as if they are not just friends. It seems like the two are just hiding their true feelings for each other."
