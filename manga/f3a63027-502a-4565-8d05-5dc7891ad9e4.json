    "en": "Izuru said he'd stop one second before he kissed Rikka... So why are they really kissing right now!? Rikka's first kiss is on stage performing a play...! Rikka and Izuru have been friends since they were kids. Izuru's always bossing Rikka around. Rikka has to write the script for their school festival play, which is a relief because at least she can steer clear of Izuru, who's playing the leading role of the prince... But on performance day, the princess gets sick, and Rikka has to take her place! She's dreading the final kissing scene. They're just supposed to pretend, but now... their lips are... touching...! She knows it's Izuru... but he looks like a handsome prince, and... he's actually kinda hot..."
