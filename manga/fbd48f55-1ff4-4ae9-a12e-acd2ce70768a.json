    "en": "Contains 4 stories.\r\n\r\nStory 01: I Can\u0026rsquo;t Stand You: Although Rena-chan likes Miyake, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything about it, because Mariko has turned her feminine charm to full throttle! However, in no time at all, Mariko finds out about her rival in love, Rena! \r\n\r\nStory 02: Caught on You: Relationships haven\u0026rsquo;t gone too well for Maho throughout her life. Why is that? It all started with her first love, Shiki. What happened between these two? Will Maho be able to get over the past and find a new love? Or will one of her past loves be able to bloom once again?\r\n\r\nStory 03: Something\u0026rsquo;s Wrong: Misono, who doesn't look very feminine, begins to have feelings for her childhood friend and neighbor, Yuuta. Will she be able to catch his eye by dressing in a more feminine way, especially when his attention seems to have been stolen by the pretty and stylish Sugisaki?\r\n\r\nStory 04: See You Tomorrow: Akemi\u0026rsquo;s in high school, and she doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care about grades. Or rather, she didn\u0026rsquo;t care until she got a new tutor \u0026ndash; the college student Tanami-sensei. She thinks he\u0026rsquo;s a real cutie, so she\u0026rsquo;s going to do her best for him! Will her feelings be able to reach him? Will this become a forbidden love between tutor and student?"
