   "en": "The story is set in a dystopian near future where the Japan society is experiencing a crime rampage and in which a powerful and secret religious organization, with mysterious goals, is acting as an invisible hand behind the scenes.  \n  \nThe main character is their strongest assassin, lent to them by his fanatic mother when he was a child, and now a ruthless killing machine whose fists and feet cause serious damage to his adversaries, and whose weapon of choice is a special cutting wire with which he grabs and scorches his opponents.  \n  \nHe’s a man hunter, whose childhood has been stolen and molded after his tormentors, but when the road of forgiveness is precluded to him what can be left to a man to obtain the redemption?  \n  \nTakeo finds the answer in the vengeance, and in eradicating that same evil from which he has born.  \n  \nSo this dark and impressive badass guy, after betraying the sept, gets down to business kicking their ass and unleashing his fury against the deadly opponents sent to stop his unparalleled revenge."
