Ready to live the rest of his life hiding his feelings, Gyulwoo is shocked when Hojun, his old friend from high school, appears. In the past, Hojun had revealed he loved Gyulwoo but Gyulwoo wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready to accept his love. Decades later, will Gyulwoo keep their romance secret or will he finally share his heart with Hojun and the world?"
