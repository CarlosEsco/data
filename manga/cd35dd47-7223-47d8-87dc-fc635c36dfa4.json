   "en": "Hitto Tamaga, an 11-year-old boy, lives in some town in Japan. He is a very unfortunate boy, whose only asset is brightness. He lives only with his father who is a B-daman researcher, but he left home several months ago, and he's been missing since then. He is living alone in a hut built on a relative’s land. Nobody celebrates his 11th birthday…except his cousin Nana who lives in the same land. One day, Hitto receives a present from the lost father, and he is very grad to know that his father remembers his birthday. It is “Crash B-daman” that he longed for. After he puts them together to complete Crash B-daman, he brings it to B-Park, or a battle field of B-daman. A battle there shows him a new way he should go.  \n  \nThere is a message from his father with the present.  \n  \n“Overcome the difficulties”.  \n  \nPutting this word in his mind, he beats the enemies one after another with his B-daman. With the encounter of partners and rivals, the mystery of B-daman, a shadow organization, and the reason of the missing of his father gradually come to light. Defeating various obstacles in his way, he’s growing up."
