However, Kiyoko realises that Hoshino isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly what he seems to be, when she discovers him working at his family\u0026rsquo;s run-down convenience store! But even in his dull work clothes, Hoshino is still sparkling to her. But it\u0026rsquo;s not until Hoshino is confessed to by another girl that Kiyoko truly realizes that even if she\u0026rsquo;s different from Hoshino\u0026rsquo;s ideal girl, she still has a chance\u0026hellip; but is it too late now for her?"
