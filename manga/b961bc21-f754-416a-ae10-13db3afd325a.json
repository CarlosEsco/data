    "en": "Takagami Riu graduated from middle school. All of his dreams as a normal student had vanished - he was assigned to become a student soldier \u0026quot;Gakuhei\u0026quot; and filled his life with trainings. After the hard training session, Riu was called by instructor and appointed as a \u0026quot;BodyGuard,\u0026quot; demanded from a magician officer. \u0026quot;Why it has to be me?\u0026quot; Riu asked this question to himself, and what awaits for him was a cute girl that dressed weird."
