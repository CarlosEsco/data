    "en": "Mushoku Kika was born in an ancient family in the East. They were rumored to have been a well-known demon family in Shinano, but it was gradually forgotten because of the decline of the name. Until later, under the excavation of the destiny, it was revived belonging to Schicksal, and changing the surname to \u0026quot;Mushoku\u0026quot;. \r\n\r\nThe \u0026quot;Mushoku\u0026quot; family has since shouldered an important mission, that is, standing in the shadow of human civilization against Houkai, becoming a pawn of Schicksal, and constantly  providing them with the Valkyrie, their value is only to eliminate Houkai, without leaving your own traces.\r\n\r\nJust like fire, from the moment of birth, it has already been destined for its own destiny."
