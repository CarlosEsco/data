    "en": "Soura's out fishing with his sister, mother, father and other fishermen when they come across a storm which wrecks a ship. Sola's parents head out to rescue the survivors, though Sola questions why since the destroyed ship is a Velinard merchant ship. His father says that it has nothing to do with the fisherman, that they're fellow sailors just like them, not to just abandon them. Sola's mother, Mana tells Sola that he should always look after his friends, and as a man to be able to protect the woman he's in love with. A black dragon suddenly appears, is shown to be the one causing the storm. A white dragon also appears, and seems to be fighting with the black dragon. Sola falls into the ocean, is wondering if that white dragon is watching over him."
