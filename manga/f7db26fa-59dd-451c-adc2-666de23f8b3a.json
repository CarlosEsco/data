    "en": "The mangaka Sakura, Kaede, her son who goes to correspondence school, Akemi, who works for an event planning company, and her two grade schoolers Taichi and Ruru. The peaceful, free, and tender daily lives of the two fatherless households who live and support each other.\r\n\u0026ldquo;As their livelihoods are updated, the subtle, but important are weaved in day by day. How nice, perhaps I would have liked to have been brought up in such a family.\u0026rdquo; (Yasuyuki Okamura, Musician)"
