    "en": "It's World War I, and all countries are at war. Germany is in search for Italy, Rome's grandson, and take him captive. Instead... he finds a box of tomatoes?\r\nOh, no, it's just useless Italy hiding. But there was one detail someone forgot to mention. Italy is annoying. So Germany couldn't be happier when he got rid of Italy at the end of war.\r\nNow it is World War II, everything is going smoothly with Germany's invasion, when the worst thing possible happens. Italy becomes Germany's ally. And this is how our story begins.\r\n\r\nThis is the original web comic, and thus it includes a large amount of chapters and events that are not included in the published book format, and the published book format includes some strips that are not included in the original web comic."
