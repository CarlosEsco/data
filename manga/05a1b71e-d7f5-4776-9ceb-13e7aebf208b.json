    "en": "Dr. Taima is not your average doctor: a skilled acupuncturist with the ability to wield the taimashin (needles that control the flow of chi in things and are used to banish demons). He is often called upon to drive demons out of possessed persons that devour anything within their grasp - dogs, cats...even other people! Accompanied by his charming assistant, Togetsu Maki, Dr. Taima travels near and far to deal with these other-word maladies--often at the risk of his own life.\r\n\r\nTaima's investigation leads him to Dunwich, Massachusetts, where he meets another needle wielder, Kyogo Ayakashi. As they encounter ancient evils that are best kept secret, how will these taimashin masters bait their prey?"
