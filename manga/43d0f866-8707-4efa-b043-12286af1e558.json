    "en": "A girl who would die for romance, Bora, fell in love with a beautiful cheating dog-seller one day. She tries to find him with only the information of his school, but fails miserably. Just as she was about to give up, Bora gets an offer to be a substitute for a daughter of a rich, prestigious family who looks just like herself. Dumbstruck, Bora rejects the offer, but changes her mind drastically when she saw that the daughter goes to the same school as her prince. Bora attends to school with a thumping heart, but as it happens, life just never gets easy!"
