    "en": "Nao, a 40-year-old man, goes into a gay club with his close buddies and sees a handsome, young man in his twenties, looking bewildered. He approaches the young man, Touma, in order to help ease him into his first time at the club. After a brief conversation, they leave the club and end up having sex together. Nao realizes how compatible they were and was doubting whether he should call Touma for another meet-up again \u0026ndash; until Rei, Nao's son, visits him at work, together with another a boy he is friends with in school, which happens to be... Touma."
