Upon regaining consciousness, he was being auctioned off as a slave.\r\n\r\nNaked and bound, Tsukasa has taken the interest of many 'buyers' whose identities were hidden behind the masks.\r\n\r\nOne particular buyer, the Earl, has bid the highest price and to Tsukasa's surprise, the Earl himself is none other  than the person who used to live in the Nikaido household for ten years?"
