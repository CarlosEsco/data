The nations desperate to avoid war, not wanting to ravage their lands, managed to agree to settle the matter using a styling contests for ownership of Sayet's treasures.   \n  \nThis styling contest was far more intense then anyone could have imagined, having lasted as long as 9 days, and being remembered in history as the \"Nine-Day War\".  \n  \nEight years later, the war is over and peace has been established between the nations. However, things are not what they seem, and the wind of war has started to blow again.   \n  \nNikki, a normal girl from earth is summoned to this new world of stylist know as Miraland, as she may be Miralands' last hope to shift the course of the land's fate."
