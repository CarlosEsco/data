    "en": "Yamanobi Apartments have a story behind them: Anyone who lives there will gain something big, but lose something big as well. This is a collection of stories about the various tenants and their love lives.\r\n\r\n1) Muroi Kaname has just moved into Yamanobi. The naturally unsocial Kaname doesn't care about stories, and also quickly manages to alienate himself from everyone in the building. But when his upstairs neighbor, talkative Fujimura, sees a different side to him, he's determined to be Kaname's friend. Kaname slowly lets himself grow closer to Fujimura, but will their friendship withstand the jinx?\r\n\r\n2) Kamimura Mizuki has always chosen lovers for their looks, and gotten nothing but trouble. This time he wants a sincere guy, and he already has one picked out: Itokawa from his work. But getting his attention is proving to be somewhat difficult. At least slacker apartment caretaker Akabame always listens to his troubles...\r\n\r\n3) Nojima is known as the life of the party, always light-hearted and in a good mood. But he's really a bundle of insecurities! He's hiding a secret love for cool classmate Kariya and has moved into Yamanobi for the jinx. But his secret love is slowly turning him into a stalker!\r\n\r\nextra) Kanata has been in love with Soejima Ibuki for two years now, but he always sees Soejima-san with a new partner. Will Kanata be able to tell Soejima how he feels or will he suffer with an unrequited love forever?\r\n\r\nextra 2) 3 short comedies on the residents of Yamanobi Apartments."
