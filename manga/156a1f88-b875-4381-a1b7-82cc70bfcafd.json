   "en": "Takeda is diagnosed with cancer and feels that he has nothing to live for. His wife also had had cancer, had died of it in fact, and his only daughter has been missing for fourteen years.  \n  \nOne day, when he is about to attempt suicide, the phone rings. It’s the police, and they inform him that the dead body of his long lost daughter has been found, that it appears to have been a homicide. Takeda is crushed but resolves then and there to spend the remaining days of his life hunting down his daughter’s killer.  \n  \nThe time left for Takeda to live equals the time left to put the murderer behind bars. Life is a heart-wrenching story about a father’s willpower and his search for the truth."
