    "en": "As unpopular as DDD itself. A story featuring featuring \u0026ldquo;Ookumaneko Mokumoku\u0026rdquo; -until then just a side character- and a well-known little sister: \u0026ldquo;Ishizue Kanata\u0026rdquo;. Shunji Enomoto drew a short manga based on its events (pic related).\r\n\r\nAcross the story we can see a Kanata with the urge to kill some time (and other things), making her way out of her chamber (more like a prison) with the help of the docile Origa Vice-president. Then, Kanata resolves going to a room nobody has stepped in for a long time. That room was located in her own ward; \u0026ldquo;Ward D\u0026rdquo; and its number was: \u0026ldquo;The Room No.404\u0026Prime;, however, as this room was a mystery to even those patients (monsters) of Ward D and even though what lied inside resulted very attractive to pry into, no one tried doing it before, after all, the Hospital files didn\u0026rsquo;t even consider an active room anymore.\r\n\r\nBefore she destroys the iron door intruding in her way, a dim, puzzling voice spoke a few words, resembling a warning to her:\r\n\r\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t come in. Don\u0026rsquo;t come in. You cannot withstand my power. If you come in you\u0026rsquo;ll regret it.\u0026rdquo;\r\n\u0026ldquo;Cherish life, don\u0026rsquo;t enter my world.\u0026rdquo;\r\n\r\n\u0026hellip;this of course was the voice of Mokumoku, a 30 years old NEET who hid an unimaginable power."
