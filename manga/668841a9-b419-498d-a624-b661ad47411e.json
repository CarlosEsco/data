    "en": "Volume 1: Chintsubu A\r\nPart 1 \u0026ndash; Iwabuchi starts hanging out with girls from his cram school, and Kamiya-chinko freaks out. What is he up to?\r\nPart 2 \u0026ndash; Toride's soul moves up to Ayase's nipple.\r\n\r\nVolume 2: Chintsubu B\r\nWhen Iwabuchi engages in more chinko cosplay, Kamiya is upset and they get into another fight. The cosplay chinkos are not to be missed in this!\r\n\r\nVolume 3: Chintsubu C\r\nPart 1 \u0026ndash; The chinkos are having a big discussion over what to do when they want to get off and their \u0026quot;bodies\u0026quot; don't.\r\nPart 2 \u0026ndash; Gives us the backstory on Iwabuchi's first impressions of Kamiya, when they first met long before the accident. \r\n\r\nVolume 4: Chintsubu D\r\nKamiya injures his hand and can't engage in mutual jerking off with Iwabuchi, leading to a REALLY big fight.\r\n\r\nVolume 5: Chintsubu E\r\nIt's summer and the chinko alliance head to the pool for some swimming fun, but can chinkos even swim?\r\n\r\nVolume 6: Chintsubu F\r\nWhen Toride-chinko disappears one night, Ayase panics. The next morning, Hiro reveals that he has performed a successful remote exorcism on Toride-chinko, but when Toride-kun shows up at school with no memory of Ayase or the chinbi (chinko secret), Ayase tries to be optimistic about making Toride-kun fall for him all over again. What happened to Toride-chinko? Is he gone for good? Will Toride remember the chinbi and his feelings for Ayase?\r\n\r\nVolume 7: Chintsubu G\r\nIn this installment of Chintsubu, Toride must come to terms with the fact that his chinko talks \u0026ndash; and that it's fixated on Ayase. Ayase struggles to resurrect Toride's memories the only way he knows how: by working some hand magic on Toride-chinko. Unfortunately, he fails his mission and freaks Toride out in the process. Will Toride-kun be able to accept his wacky anatomy as anything other than a strange hallucination? Will he find the courage to talk to Ayase again, or will his fear of his over-excited appendage keep him down? This couple's drama gives Kamiya plenty of food for thought regarding his own relationship with Iwabuchi."
