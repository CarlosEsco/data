    "en": "Collection of oneshots.\r\n\r\n1) Physical Attraction\r\nWhen I met the cool stud Narusawa at college I said half-jokingly, \u0026quot;Screw me next!\u0026quot; Before the day was out, he had. Our relationship was supposed to be just physical, but now I realize I'm falling in love with Narusawa. Looking back on it, it's a one-way love I brought upon myself. I'm much too embarrassed to tell the purely physical Narusawa \u0026quot;I love you\u0026quot; now!\r\n\r\n2) February Rain\r\nOne rainy night, part-time worker and university student Chihiro stops a kid from dine-and-dashing. Turns out this kid, Masami, doesn't have a place to go...\r\n\r\n3) Anti-Dramatic (Sequel to 'Baby Maybe')\r\nShiba and Yushima had been together a while now, they're off to college and it's time they move in together. Now they have to deal with the little everyday problems in life.\r\n\r\n4) Let me Knock on the same Door\r\nImamura and Toyohara work at a game software company together. They're close friend... and Toyohara also has some interest in Imamura.\r\n\r\n5) Cooled Passion\r\nArisaka's next big story is supposed to be about Tsutsumi, now a politician and his old friend. 7 years since their parting, what will happen if they're suddently reunited?\r\n\r\n6) Loving Attraction (Physical Attraction Extra)\r\nA nice little extra about Kurata and Narusawa from Chapter 1 who are wondering if they should be going on a summer vacation or not."
