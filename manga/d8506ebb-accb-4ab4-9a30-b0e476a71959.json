    "en": "Seinen is quite popular and yet he has nothing he could get himself into and had no experience of falling in love. This made Seinen annoyed with himself. One after school, he found Noiri in the music room, playing the piano and decided to learn the cello from him. It was just something that started from a whim but as they spend time together, Seinen fell for Noiri. But it seems, Noiri is hiding a secret\u0026hellip;?"
