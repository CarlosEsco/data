    "en": "A+ student Ichinose Taiyo is the brains of his class. His grades are always high, he's generally liked by his classmates and everyone thinks he will get into a good college then onto a financially well-off career. But his life long dream that no one else, not even his family, knows about is to be a manga author, which realistically speaking has near impossible odds of working out. The reasons why he keeps it a secret is because he'd rather not try if he's more than likely to fail and also because he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to end up like his classmate Anezaki Runa.\r\n\r\nRuna is also aspiring to be a manga author but is obsessed with it to the point where everyone keeps a distance from her because of her anti-social and weird habits. But one day, Runa finds out about Taiyo\u0026rsquo;s secret and forces him to pursue his dream. Taiyo learns that throughout his life, he has cared too much about public perception which will continue to limit his ability as a manga author unless he opens himself up even if it means rejection. With Runa\u0026rsquo;s help, he learns to believe in his dream and show his true potential. [vyc]"
