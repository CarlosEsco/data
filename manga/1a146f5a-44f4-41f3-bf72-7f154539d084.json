   "en": "\"There's no need to hold back. Let me hear your natural voice...\" In this world lurks monsters called sound-eaters. Because they react to sound and take the life of anyone they touch, people live their lives while keeping their voice down whenever outside. A young girl in the village, Towa, is a songstress with the power to fight back against the sound-eaters, but because of her inexperience, she couldn't do anything. One day, Towa is saved from a sound-eater's attack by a swordsman. \"What a beautiful voice... Next time, won't you sing just for me?\" ...Attracted to his mysterious charm, Towa starts living with him, reasoning that it's to nurse his injuries. Loosening up to one another, they kiss... \"Don't you want to feel me deeper?\" Every time she's gently stroked, Towa climaxes from the unknown, sweet stimulation... but he had a secret he couldn't tell..."
