    "en": "Description by the English Translator:\r\n_____________________________________\r\n\r\nHisashi Eguchi makes fun of a whole bunch of dead people in this parody of Tokiwa-sou Seishun. Tokiwa-sou was a legendary 2-story apartment building that housed several noteworthy Manga-ka in the 1950s, most notably Osamu Tezuka and the duo behind the Fujiko Fujio pen name. Stories of Tokiwa-sou have been chronicled in manga such as Tokiwa-sou Monogatari, in which each occupant contributed a short story about their time in the building, as well as Manga Michi, an autobiographical manga by Fujiko Fujio (A) about the industry (made well before the high-energy shonen-focused Bakuman).\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, this strip is kinda only funny if you know all the references being made, but I\u0026rsquo;ve included some notes to help people out. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s still interesting nonetheless."
