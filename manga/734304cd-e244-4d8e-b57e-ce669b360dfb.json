Tokiwa-sou was a legendary 2-story apartment building that housed several noteworthy Manga-ka in the 1950s, most notably Osamu Tezuka and the duo behind the Fujiko Fujio pen name. Stories of Tokiwa-sou have been chronicled in manga such as Tokiwa-sou Monogatari, in which each occupant contributed a short story about their time in the building, as well as Manga Michi, an autobiographical manga by Fujiko Fujio (A) about the industry (made well before the high-energy shonen-focused Bakuman).  \n  \nAdmittedly, this strip is kinda only funny if you know all the references being made, but I’ve included some notes to help people out. Maybe it’s still interesting nonetheless."
