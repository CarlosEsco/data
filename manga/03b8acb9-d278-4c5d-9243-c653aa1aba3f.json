   "en": "Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers: The Comics collects every issue of the original Generation 1 Transformers manga published in the pages of TV Magazine.   \n  \n**Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers Prologue**  \nHundreds of thousands of years ago there existed a highly-advanced planet called Cybertron. The planet was controlled by two factions of super robot lifeforms: the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons.  \nTheir endless war drained Cybertron of all its energy, leading to both factions leaving the planet in search of new energy sources. Their battle raged on, eventually reaching the vicinity of prehistoric Earth.  \n  \n**Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers**  \nTrouble is brewing in Tokyo, Japan – Starscream, Skywarp and Thundercracker are on the attack, out to pillage energy and cause some general destruction. But the Autobots have pursued their foes to Japan, and Optimus Prime, Smokescreen, Wheeljack, Trailbreaker and Sideswipe speed onto the scene, just in time for Prime to transform and save a young boy named Kenji.  \n  \n**The Story of Super Robot Lifeforms: The Transformers**  \nResponding to an SOS, an Autobot team consisting of Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Kup, Blurr, Springer and Arcee head into space at full speed, and discover the spaceship that sent the call for help held prisoner by another.  \n  \n**The Great Transformer War**  \nThe Decepticons have captured Dalton, a brilliant scientist from the planet Elan, but he is refusing to work with them, and the Aerialbots and Protectobots are already on their way towards Trypticon to rescue him.  \n  \n**Great Decisive Battle of Planet Beast!**  \nWith White Leo and Rodimus Prime away, the Decepticons and their Beastformer allies make another attempt to conquer planet Beast.  \n  \n**Transformers: The Headmasters**  \nAs the Autobots and the recently-arrived Autobot Headmasters ruminate on the current state of play – the death of Optimus Prime, their base on the planet Athenia, the power of the Headmasters – Galvatron leads the Decepticon Headmasters in a plot to destroy Battleship Maximus.  \n  \n**Transformers: Super-God Masterforce**  \nAfter the events of The Headmasters, the Autobots and Decepticons have departed Earth… or have they?   \n  \n**Transformers: Victory**   \nThe Victory War begins as Star Saber and Deathsaurus face-off on Earth!  \n  \n**Transformers: Zone**  \nWhen nine of the most powerful Decepticons are gathered together under the rule of Violen Jiger, Autobot Powered Master Dai Atlas must step forward to prevent them from acquiring the power of the mystical Zodiac.   \n  \n**Transformers: The Battlestars**  \nSuper Megatron attempts to pillage energon from an oil rig, only to be confronted by Star Convoy!"
