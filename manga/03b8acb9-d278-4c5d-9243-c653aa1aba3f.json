Super Robot Lifeform Transformers Prologue[/b]\r\nHundreds of thousands of years ago there existed a highly-advanced planet called Cybertron. The planet was controlled by two factions of super robot lifeforms: the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons.\r\nTheir endless war drained Cybertron of all its energy, leading to both factions leaving the planet in search of new energy sources. Their battle raged on, eventually reaching the vicinity of prehistoric Earth.\r\n\r\n[b]Fight!
