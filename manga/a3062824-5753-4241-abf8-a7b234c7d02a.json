   "en": "I possessed a character in a novel that I stopped writing as a hobby when I was in high school.\n\nMy mother died in an accident, and my father is rumored to be dead right after he went to jail. Thanks to that, I became an orphan girl at the age of seven without a name.\n\nWhile living in another person’s house, I was exhausted from working and was caught running away. Then sold to s*ave traders. I was wondering if this life is meant to be ruined. The reputable Duke, the Empire’s greatest villain bought me.\n\n“She’s 7 years old, but was small and too thin.”\n\nHenriette, the worst villain in the original, whose hobby is making everyone act like a puppet, playing tricks on the imperial family, and threatening the neck of the aristocracy, it turned out that scary man is my real father who went to jail!\n\nBut you seem a little different from the original villain.\n\n“Well, duke…”\n“No.”\n“…..Oh, father?”\n“That, too.”\n“……uh, Daddy?”\n“Yes, my daughter. What do you want to have today?”\n\nHenriette, who I thought was scary, is more friendly than I thought.\n\n“If anyone bothers you from now on, you have to tell your big brother, okay? I’ll drown them at the bottom of the lake.”\n“Shall I go see flowers with my little sister today? There are so many ornamental mermaids in the glass greenhouse. I thought you would like it, so I caught it myself. Did I do a good job?”\n“This slow girl! Dad called you…. No, I’m not mad! Damn it, don’t be s*upid! Ahhh! Yeah! I’m wrong! Okay?”\n\nThe new brothers were definitely villains in the original, but they are much nicer than I thought.\n\n“You can do whatever you want. Anyone in the family, if you say so, will listen carefully and do what you say.”\n\nBut it’s weird. The novel I wrote wasn’t originally like this.\n\n***\n\n“….If you promise me a few things, I’ll stay with you again. I won’t leave you.”\n“You can see me anytime without an appointment.”\n“Should I? I can always run away to a place where you will never find me again.”\n\nHe frowned his eyebrows.\n\nIf I had known that a small word of expression would have caused such a terrible reaction, I would have kept my mouth shut then. It was when I was in the middle of regretting,\n\n“You’re mistaken. Do you think I will let you go in the first place, shouldn’t that be possible first?”\n“….What?”\n“Who said I’d let you run away?”\n\n……No matter how much I think about it, I think I got it wrong.\n\n“If you’ll really run away, you shouldn’t be caught by me again.”"
