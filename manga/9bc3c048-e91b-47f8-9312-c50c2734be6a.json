    "en": "Humans have been in a secret war against the Rakshasa for thousands of years. Humans, by making and eating magical food called Spirit Food, can break the limits of the human body to fight back against the Rakshasa, who hunt humans to take their Spirit Energy. Gong Sun Wu Ming is a seventeen-year-old master chef, running the Divine Palace restaurant. His parents vanished ten years ago, leaving behind only the Divine Palace and a cooking knife that has been passed down through generations. But he has a secret: there is a monster in his stomach, forcing him to eat massive amounts of food. When Gong Sun Wu Ming inadvertently gets involved in the Human-Rakshasa war, he finds that there's a lot more to what his parents left him. However, there's no time to dwell on that: a girl is desperately trying to make him fall in love with her!\r\n[hr][b]Links[/b]:\r\n[*][url=https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc29165]Original Manhua (Bilibili)[/url]"
