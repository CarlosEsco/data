    "en": "Tsukiwaka might be a fan of cute and girly things, but actually he can\u0026rsquo;t handle women well. One day, a strange, beautiful woman named Hinako showed up on his campus. She handed a hand-made lunch box to Tsukiwaka while smiling, \u0026ldquo;I am your wife.\u0026rdquo;\r\nSince he is bad with women, Tsukiwaka thought he could resist such an unexpected self-declaration, but why does Hinako make his heart race? Should Tsukiwaka go along with her play?"
