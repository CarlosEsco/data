    "en": "Kyouko 'Kyodoko' Ogawa, who works at an underwear company, meets the person she was in love with in her university days once more at her workplace. Even though she ought to have been able to fall in love with someone else at least once, she ends up realising that the curse of Hoshina, who hurt and controlled her, was stronger than those feelings. At the same time as Kyodoko once more gets mired in the maze that is Hoshina of her own will, he has a relationship with her kouhai and even manipulates her work as he likes---?"
