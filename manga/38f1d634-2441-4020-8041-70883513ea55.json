    "en": "Born during the sunrise - an auspicious beginning - the Azumas' newborn son is named Hikaru, which means \u0026quot;light.\u0026quot; But during one play date, his mother notices that her son is slightly different from the other children. In this alternately heartwarming and bittersweet tale, a young mother tries to cope with both the overwhelming discovery of her child's autism and the trials of raising him while keeping her family together. This is a story that resonates not only for those whose families have been affected by autism, but also for all past, present, and future parents.\r\n\r\nNote: Won an Excellence Prize for manga at the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival.\r\n\r\n(Source: Yen Press)"
