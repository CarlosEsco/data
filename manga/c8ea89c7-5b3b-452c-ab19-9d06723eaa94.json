   "en": "Cute and child-like high schooler Suzu has an affinity with animals. She wasn't aware of just how much so until the day a large black cat literally falls into her arms! She wakes up after taking the injured cat home to treat its wounds, and finds a naked boy, \"Noa\" in her bedroom! He claims to be the cat, \"Noir\".  \n  \nIt appears that someone is after Noir as they are suddenly attacked by cats. Suzu can sense they are being controlled against their will. After their escape Noir/Noa is impressed by her bravery and the fact that she can understand animals–so much so that he asks her to have his babies!  \n  \nPoor Suzu, what is she to do with this cat-boy who's determined to stay close to her, VERY close? And what of those who are just as determined to get Noir back?  \n(From: MU)"
