    "en": "Hy\u0026ucirc;ga \u0026amp; Wakashimazu, now both 25, are on the point of leaving Japan to play the soccer world cup. Instead of joining their team, Ken takes Hy\u0026ucirc;ga secretly to a desert island, where they'll enjoy themselves during a few days, before the world cup, and before Hy\u0026ucirc;ga's 26th birthday. A lot of reflection on their past, their evolution, how things can change with time...everything changes except love, and they proof it."
