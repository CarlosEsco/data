    "en": "Tomaru Harukaze is extremely shy and terrible with any kind of social interaction. His worried mother sends him to live with his grandparents in the countryside\u0026mdash;born and raised in Tokyo, Harukaze worries he'll have trouble adjusting, but that's not the worst part: he will be starting a part-time job at Restaurant Bell, where his grandmother is a regular customer! Not only will he have to learn to interact with customers, but he'll also have to learn to get along with his quirky coworkers."
