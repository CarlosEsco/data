    "en": "We are criticized just because we're women and hurt each other just because we're women. This is the story of women bound by the pressure of womanhood in love, work, and childbirth, who continue to live on, ragged and ungraceful. Miki Aoki is 31, single, and sick of life, but her slowly building savings balance keeps her going. She's surrounded by people like her old-fashioned boss who tosses off things like \u0026ldquo;This is why I hate women\u0026rdquo; (shut your face) and her fossil of a mother who puts pressure on her, saying things like \u0026ldquo;So when are you going to get married and have children?\u0026rdquo; (please stop talking). And then there's a younger staff member at work with whom she only has superficial relationships (just do your jobs). She could really care less about the lot of it.\r\nThis is the bitter and sad story of women who live like that, an anthem to cheer on all women."
