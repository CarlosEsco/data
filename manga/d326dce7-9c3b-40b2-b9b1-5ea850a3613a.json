     "en": "Takehiko Inoue (井上 雄彦, Inoue Takehiko, born 12 January 1967) is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for the basketball series [Slam Dunk (1990–1996)](https://mangadex.org/title/319df2e2-e6a6-4e3a-a31c-68539c140a84/slam-dunk), and the jidaigeki manga [Vagabond](https://mangadex.org/title/d1a9fdeb-f713-407f-960c-8326b586e6fd/vagabond), which are two of the best-selling manga series in history. Many of his works are about basketball, Inoue himself being a huge fan of the sport. His works sold in North America through Viz Media are **Slam Dunk**, **Vagabond** and [Real](https://mangadex.org/title/62b74aa6-24df-4b91-b76d-39e7ab3c3ca5/real), although **Slam Dunk** was earlier translated by **Gutsoon! Entertainment**. In 2012, Inoue became the first recipient of the Cultural Prize at the Asia Cosmopolitan Awards.\n\n---\nHis real name is **Nariai Takehiko (成合雄彦)**.\n\nInoue Takehiko first started playing basketball in high school as a means to winning attention from the opposite sex, he was in kendo club in elementary school and junior high. After being immersed in the competitive sport, he became a huge basketball fan.

He is best known for the basketball series [Slam Dunk (1990–1996)](https://mangadex.org/title/319df2e2-e6a6-4e3a-a31c-68539c140a84/slam-dunk), and the jidaigeki manga [Vagabond](https://mangadex.org/title/d1a9fdeb-f713-407f-960c-8326b586e6fd/vagabond), which are two of the best-selling manga series in history.
