   "en": "A schoolgirl who was adopted by a family experiences hardships at school and home. Her foster family treats her as Reika, their daughter who had died a couple years ago. Suddenly, her real blood-related brother appears before her, who has been searching for her for years. Now her life is turned upside down. Will she learn to trust other people again?  \n  \nNote: Flower of Eden was slated for release on January 2006 by TokyoPop, but was cancelled after author Yuki Suetsugu admitted to copying numerous panels from Inoue Takehiko's manga titles Slam Dunk and REAL. Kodansha has ceased distribution of all 12-volumes of Eden no Hana."
