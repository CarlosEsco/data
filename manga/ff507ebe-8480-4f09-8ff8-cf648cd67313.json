Secrets and mysteries surrounding the Zhang family began to surface, and Zhang Chunan is apparently more than just an ordinary college student desperate to be rid of his virginity.\r\n\r\n----\r\nOne day, Zhang Chulan is attacked by zombies in a graveyard. In the midst of that situation, he saves the life of a girl, throwing the kitchen knife in his hand in order to kill the enemies. The girl tells Chulan, who is relieved, to face his hardships head on and leaves. However, Chulan later sees that girl again at his university. From that moment, Zhang Chulan's destiny begins to move. There will be strangers with special powers appearing one by one, with battles involving those abilities. Each episode will bring a new mystery to light.\r\n---\r\n\r\nFirst published under the title 异人 (Yi Ren, literally: \u0026quot;Weirdo\u0026quot;) and with subtitle King of the Weirdo in February 2015.
