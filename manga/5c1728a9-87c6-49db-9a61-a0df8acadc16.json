    "en": "Drawn in 1971 and 1972, these stories expand Yoshihiro Tatsumi\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary for characters contextualized by themes of depravity and disorientation in twentieth-century Japan. Some of the tales focus on the devastation the country felt as a result of World War II, and, yet, while American influence does play a role in the disturbing and bizarre stories contained within this volume, as always, it is Tatsumi\u0026rsquo;s characters that bear his hallmark, muddling through isolated despair and fleeting pleasure to live out their darkly nuanced lives.\r\n\r\nSome of the tales focus on the devastation the country felt as a result of World War II: in one story a man devotes twenty years to preserving the memory of those killed at Hiroshima, only to discover a horrible misconception at the heart of his tribute. Yet, while American influence does play a role in the disturbing and bizarre stories contained within this volume, as always it is Tatsumi\u0026rsquo;s characters that bear his hallmark, muddling through isolated despair and fleeting pleasure to live out their darkly nuanced lives."
