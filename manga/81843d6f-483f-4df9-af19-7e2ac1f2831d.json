    "en": "THIRDS exists to uphold the law for Humans and Therians without prejudice. During the Vietnam War, biological warfare spread the Melanoe virus, infecting millions worldwide and changing the course of human history forever. The vaccine, Eppione.8, created using strains from animals immune to the virus, activated a dormant mutation within the virus that altered human DNA and gave birth to a new species: Therians.\r\nIn an attempt to restore social order, the US government put new regulations and laws into place, along with a Therian branch of government. In 1990, Human and Therian legislators launched the \u0026laquo;Therian Human Intelligence, Recon, Defense, Squadron\u0026raquo; aka the THIRDS, an elite, military-funded agency comprised of an equal number of Human and Therian agents.\r\nBut THIRDS agents are more than a team \u0026mdash; they\u0026rsquo;re a family through thick and thin, and along the way, some find true love. While every day brings dangers and challenges, one thing will never change: standing up for what you believe in and protecting the people you love is never optional.\r\nTHIRDS exists to uphold the law for Humans and Therians without prejudice.
