However, her life is turned upside down when her father left her and her two younger siblings in debt of ¥10m (approx. US$100k) in search of a national treasure to repay it!\r\n\r\nWith a huge debt to pay off, collectors at her door every other day, and two young siblings and herself to feed, she works part-time in three different jobs everyday, yet the return is close to nothing.

Being at her wits end and considering the lucrative return of the job, Nao signs the contract without a second's hesitation. When she comes to and pays careful attention to the job contract... Contract? What contract?! It's a marriage registration!\r\n\r\nThe romantic school story of a hard-working girl and her conquest marriage-of-convenience is about to begin!"
