    "en": "Onigawara Shouzou spends his days working a tiresome job at an IT company, but his life changes when, on a rainy night, he meets a goddess named Silvia\u0026mdash;and that's not an exaggeration, she's an actual goddess! That night, she stays in Shouzou's apartment, and their growing attraction to one another becomes more apparent as the night goes on...\r\n\r\nThe next 13 years of Shouzou's life pass by in a flash, and he couldn't be happier with his new job, beautiful wife Silvia, three daughters, and brand new home. But due to some unfortunate circumstances, his house and everyone in it get transported to another world full of magic and monsters! After finding out they can't go back to their world for at least a year, Shouzou decides that he must support his family the only way he knows how: by joining the sales department of a local guild!"
