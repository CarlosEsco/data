   "en": "Nevada, 1987.  \n  \n10 years after the end of the nuclear war, the country has been rebuilt. Nevertheless, thousands of civils are still irradiated. Fortunately the government developed a treatment : the G.H.O.S.T. (Gray-Human-Omegon-Synthetised-Treatment). By using it, a human being can slow down the effects of radiation on his body, but at the same time he begins to control them. That’s how men who are able to use G.H.O.S.T. to acquire incredible abilities are appearing. They are called Erynies.  \n  \nAt 23-years-old, Kama is a low-ranking bounty hunter who owns a slum in a shantytown where the irradiated people too poor to afford the G.H.O.S.T. are living. His main activity is to hunt Erynies. One day, he is asked to capture a young woman: Ananke, the leader of an extremist group which stole an H bomb in a military base. Its utilisation on the territory could mean the end of the fragile peace for the planet. But for 50 million dollars, Kama won’t be the only one looking for Ananke; he is going to go up against the greatest of bounty hunters."
