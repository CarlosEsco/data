    "en": "Yamato Edogawa is heir to a mafia family, and he harbors secret feelings for his attendant, Yoru. In all truth, he doesn't want to take over the family, but his dad and the other members won't listen to him. He's run away from home many times, and Yoru's always been the one to come get him. One day, Yamato reaches his breaking point and refuses to go home, except on one condition. \u0026quot;If you want me home that bad... You have to sleep with me!\u0026quot; While Yamato's horrified by his own outburst, Yoru doesn't seem fazed...!\r\n\r\nCould puppy love turn to something more between this future mafia boss and his beautiful tease of an attendant!? (Renta)"
