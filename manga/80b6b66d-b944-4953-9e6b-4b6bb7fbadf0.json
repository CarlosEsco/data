Divination that would lead them toward their fate, and significance to determine the successor to rule Armian.   \n  \nThe beautiful Swarda is fated to marry a throne man of Persia. The smart and calm Aspasya will encounter a great leader of history.   \n  \nBut fate has its own plan to fool with their destiny. The first and the fourth daughter have their fates entangled, to both inherit the title of Re-Manu. There can't be a country with two leaders, so one has to given way to another.
