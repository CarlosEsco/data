    "en": "Chio-chan is a gamer and a high school girl who gets into some interesting predicaments on her way to school. For instance, she was once running late for class due to staying up all night playing a game like Assassin's Creed, and her usual route was blocked. Prompted by the previous night's gaming, she decided to take to the rooftops, a strategy that does not work quite as well in real life! She also faces more mundane difficulties, like awkwardness in interacting with a friendly acquaintance met by chance on the way to school. Join Chio on her funny and unusual daily journeys to get from home to school on time. (From: MU)"
