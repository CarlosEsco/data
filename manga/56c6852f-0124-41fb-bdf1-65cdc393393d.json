    "en": "Hannah threw her letter of resignation at her boss, who called her \u0026quot;below average.\u0026quot; Still full of hurt, she visits the Blue Moon Inn, where the inn owner suggests she take a walk in the garden. That night was the night of the blue moon-- the second full moon of the month. Under the magical moonlight reflected on the derelict stone-walled church, a rude yet sexy man suddenly appears. To Hannah's astonishment, it is her offensive former boss, Roth Jerric! Why would fate punish her like this?"
