In order to save the country, Linth Highwind Belc Landa IV, Crown Prince of Landa, returns to his country determined to bring about change. But missing from his plans is a man - the one man who had left behind the intrigue of the palace for the freedom of the sea.  \n  \nGeneral Sei- Landa’s legendary hero- now guards Landa from his command post on a naval ship. Unknown to the General, among the new ensigns on board is a young Prince who is secretly plotting his return to shore!
