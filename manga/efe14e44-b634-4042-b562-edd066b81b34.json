   "en": "Ranze Etou is an adorable immortal girl with a vampire father and a werewolf mother who would throw things at each other when they get into childish fights. Ranze, however, just wants to live like a normal girl and lead a normal life. Unfortunately, she is \"blessed\" with the power to turn into anything she bites. For example, if she accidentally bites a cake the wrong way, then she will turn into a cake. The only way to return to normal is to sneeze! Ranze is in love with Shun Makabe, who is a handsome human boy at school. However, a human girl (without much hair) named Youko also likes Shun, and she will do anything to reveal that Ranze is not a human!! Things get even more complicated when Ranze meets Aaron, who is the prince of the Spirit World. Aaron falls in love with Ranze and first sight, and he will do whatever it takes to win her away from Shun… Tokimeki Tonight was one of the hottest mangas in Japan, and you sure don't want to miss this hilarious comedy!  \n  \nNOTE: This manga does NOT have defined chapters - each volume is about 150 pages of continuous artwork and story. The volumes were split into chapters by the groups for convenience."
