   "en": "\"I've been thinking from the first time I saw you – it seemed like you'd have a big one.\"  \n  \nWhile sitting in the waiting area, the receptionist, Kazama, appeared, full of neutral sexual appeal. \"Onii-san, do you like to be bullied?\" In fact, Mizushima has trauma regarding SM. He tried to resist but was forced by his ex-girlfriend, and now, he has to try resisting again, but this time against another man?!  \n-  \nFrom Renta  \n\"When I first laid eyes on you, I bet with myself that you were well-endowed.\"  \nStrait-laced office worker Ryota, who is serious to a fault, is forced to accompany his coworkers to a very special club.  \nAs he's waiting nervously, the androgynous and alluring receptionist Sho is the one that comes to his room.  \nRyota, traumatized by a past incident, is resistant to the idea of submission, but falls prey to Sho's domineering skills in the bedroom…  \nIs Ryota just one step away from becoming an obedient puppy!?"
