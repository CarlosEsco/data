    "en": "In the mid 21st century, the human race is facing a test.\r\n\r\nGenetic engineering has changed the world, and with huge profits, research had accelerated accordingly. An \u0026ldquo;immortality\u0026rdquo; gene no longer seemed like a mere dream. However, a lab sample containing this gene escaped, creating a new life-form that took in genetic material from the natural world, evolving into an enemy that began to invade the human world.\r\n\r\nThe \u0026ldquo;Shaher\u0026rdquo; are now a force capable of defeating human military forces, and both North and South American continents have fallen under their control. In Japan, the government has created a \u0026ldquo;Samurai\u0026rdquo; unit to oppose the Shaher, utilizing soldiers enhanced with nano-machines to connect with an armored exoskeleton.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that Tsukahara Takemichi is assigned to the first platoon of the \u0026ldquo;Samurai Force\u0026rdquo;."
