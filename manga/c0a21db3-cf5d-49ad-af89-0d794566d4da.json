With Haruma’s suggestion of a marriage that would benefit both parties, Ritsu decided to accept his proposal in order to escape from the corner he was driven into. Little did he know that married life with Haruma, who loves taking care of others, would be so comfortable… Plus, he gives massages that are out of this world…!  \n  \nAlthough it started with a lie, a sweet and delicious marriage love between the two single, handsome office workers in their thirties starts to bloom!\""
