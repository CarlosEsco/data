    "en": "Gifuko is a robot in the form of a cute little girl. Unlike other robots, Gifuko is able to feel emotions and learn new ones by experiencing them. She lives with a professor who always has a bear mask on and goes on daily adventures outside to learn new emotions. As she becomes friends with all the people in her town, she is able to sync up their emotions with hers and downloads it into her own data file. With each new friend she makes and every connection Gifuko makes with them, she becomes closer to becoming human."
