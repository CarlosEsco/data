One morning, Akira Yamada, a baseball club manager who worked hard to clean the room before morning training, got kissed by a male student who had fallen down from a tree!!! The criminal who stole the lips of Yamada, who is serious and stiff and a pure baseball player, is the endlessly sleeping classmate, Niimi Asa. Niimi was penalized for arriving late to help out the baseball club and Akira was forced to chaperone him. After that, Yamada often became the prey of Niimi\u0026rsquo;s troublesome habits. He was hugged and kissed\u0026hellip;and his innocent baseball lover heart was shaken. What\u0026rsquo;s more troublesome is the name Niimi calls while sleeping. It seems Niimi is having a physical relationship with his childhood friend, Kagerura Sho.\r\n\r\n\u0026ldquo;So\u0026hellip; You have to be lovers, otherwise, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it?\u0026rdquo;"
