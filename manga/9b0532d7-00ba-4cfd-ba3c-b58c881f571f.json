    "en": "In the center of the land lies the human kingdom of Radiata and surrounding it are the lands of fairies, elves and goblins. The relationships between the two species were never good but things got worse after the attack of the dragons.\r\n\r\nToday is the Knighthood entrance exam for Ridley Silverlake and she has been training for this moment her entire life. Winning the tournament today means she will be initiated into the knighthood. Her first round is against a boy her age named Jack Russel and she defeats him with ease. She fights her way to the finals where she becomes the champion and a knight only to find out that Jack, who is the son of the legendary dragon slayer, was also inducted.\r\n\r\nThis is Ridley's Side of the story. Based on the homonymous game."
