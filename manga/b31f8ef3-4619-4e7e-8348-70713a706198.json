   "en": "It's a big step for Matsuo Meina as she moved away from home in Okinawa to Tokyo so that she can attend high school. Meina is to live with her older cousin Aki who she has always had a crush on and hasn't seen in years. But to her surprise, Aki has a pet owl, Muffler, living with him in the house. He is doing research on owls at his college as well as being an extreme owl enthusiast. Meina has had issues with birds since she was young and has never had to deal with owls let alone live with one."
