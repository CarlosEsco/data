   "en": "The year is 1992. Meiko Uehara, a young college student, starts work part-time at a PC shop to make a little spare cash. One day, however, she goes up to the second floor of the shop and discovers a secret - the PC shop is a front for Alcohol Soft, a developer of erotic “bishoujo” PC games. Lacking sufficient manpower, the head of Alcohol Soft asks Meiko if she can help out as a graphic artist. \n\nDrawing with a mouse! Dithering! Debugging! The game development scene in 1992 is not an easy one. Will Meiko be able to make it in the gaming world?\n\nDrawn by Tamiki Wakaki (The World God Only Knows), with firsthand accounts by Misato Mitsumi and Tatsuki Amazuyu (developers at AQUAPLUS, who helped create To Heart, Tears to Tiara, Utawarerumono, and more), this series initially started as a doujinshi before being released as a compiled manga."
