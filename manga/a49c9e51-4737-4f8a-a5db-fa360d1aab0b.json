    "en": "Takao Hongauchi is a creepy, 28-year-old geek who's lived his whole life without ever going on a single date. After getting into a bicycle accident, he wakes up to find himself in the body of a college girl... a girl with a name very similar to his: Tacao Hongauchi. Apparently, their souls have been switched, and he has to go on a date with this girl's boyfriend, Tsubasa! At first, Takao doesn't know what to do... His new body reacts from muscle memory, and every time he sees Tsubasa, his heart starts pounding! Who knew it'd feel so good to be in a girl's body...?"
