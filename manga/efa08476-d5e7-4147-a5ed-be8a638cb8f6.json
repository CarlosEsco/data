She is unable to go to school or relate to her friends or family. One day in the hospital where she receives counseling, she is stuck in an elevator with a young girl, Nagisawa Nayu, who has not spoken since her family was killed in the Kobe earthquake. Now Nayu's only family is Nagisawa Issei, her cousin. He is a medical student working in the hospital where Aya receives treatment. As the story progresses, these three people, who have lost those they loved most in terrible accidents, learn how to start living again."
