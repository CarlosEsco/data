    "en": "Midway through the Twenty-first century, an integrated global computer network manages much of the world\u0026rsquo;s affairs. A proposed major software upgrade\u0026mdash;an artificial intelligence\u0026mdash;will give the system an unprecedented degree of independent decision-making power, but serious questions are raised in regard to how much control can safely be given to a non-human intelligence. In order to more fully assess the system, a new space-station habitat\u0026mdash;a world in miniature\u0026mdash;is developed for deployment of the fully operational system, named Spartacus. This mini-world can then be \u0026ldquo;attacked\u0026rdquo; in a series of escalating tests to assess the system\u0026rsquo;s responses and capabilities. If Spartacus gets out of hand, the system can be shut down and the station destroyed . . . unless Spartacus decides to take matters into its own hands and take the fight to Earth. (From: Dark Horse)\r\n\r\nAdapted from James P. Hogan\u0026rsquo;s classic science-fiction novel by the award-winning Yukinobu Hoshino, The Two Faces of Tomorrow is hardcore science-fiction manga at its best. (From: MU)\r\n\r\nLicensed in English by Dark Horse as [i]The Two Faces of Tomorrow[/i]."
