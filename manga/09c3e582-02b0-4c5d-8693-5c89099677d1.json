    "en": "In a certain kingdom, a prophecy was made about a child born with a birthmark on his back. It was said that he would bring an end to the kingdom, and that his death would bring about its destruction. When the twin prince and princess were born, Len and Rin, Len was discovered to have the birthmark. He was banished to a lonely tower, and Rin was raised as the only princess. However, it ended up being impossible to keep the siblings apart, and soon they formed a deep friendship. Although circumstances may pull them apart, nothing can break the bond they have with each other. They struggle together to survive the treacherous and dangerous world they were born into. This is their story.\r\n\r\nBased on the original Vocaloid songs \u0026quot;Aku no Musume\u0026quot; (\u0026quot;Daughter of Evil\u0026quot;) and \u0026quot;Aku no Meshitsukai\u0026quot; (\u0026quot;Servant of Evil\u0026quot;) by Akuno-P (mothy).\r\n\r\nThe volume released in 2011 by CR COMICS DX never had a sequel.  It seems to have been dropped or cancelled.  In 2014 two volumes were released by Birds Comics Spica Collection which seems to conclude the story."
