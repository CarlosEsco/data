   "en": "1-4) If You Took Me to a Deserted Island  \nAkagi is a regular office worker who comes face to face with one of his former classmates, Ichimori. The two men have a history: Ichimori was the star of his judo club in high school but he was forced to quit due to a leg injury unintentionally inflicted by Akagi. To be forgiven, Akagi, at the time, had offered him to do whatever he liked. So, when Ichimori reappears years later, telling Akagi that his girlfriend kicked him out and asking him to temporarily lodge him, Akagi is not entitled to refuse him his help, although he cannot help but wonder why Ichimori came back to find him after all these years.  \n  \n5-6) My Master is a Spoiled Child"
