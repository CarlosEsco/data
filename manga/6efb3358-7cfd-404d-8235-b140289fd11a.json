    "en": "Death comes for every human on Earth ... There was only one difference: not all souls rested in the same place ... There is a Heaven and Hell, also eternal ... And there is a place called \u0026quot; The Middle \u0026quot;which is between them ... This place is completely isolated, it is only for a brief ... the\u0026quot; Death \u0026quot;(Donn), is who get the souls to Earth, and also who forwards them to the right place, following the orders of his superior ... it was an unbreakable cycle, a sovereign law ... Until the \u0026quot;Death\u0026quot; ... created feelings for an earthly soul, a soul with the hours counted"
