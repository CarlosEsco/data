    "en": "From Mangaupdates: Eve was spoken to by a gorgeous, sexy guy at a party for celebrities. It was Luca Cardelli. \u0026ldquo;He hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed a bit\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Eve met him once ten years ago, but it seems as if he doesn't recall it. No wonder. He just gave a dream ticket to Eve, who was an unpolished teenager back then. But after they meet a second time, Luca is more determined than ever to have her. Even though she is now a TV broadcaster, she still doesn't fit into his upper-class world\u0026hellip;!"
