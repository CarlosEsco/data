    "en": "Computers and the internet are not just for nerds anymore. Even young girls like Rukuha use it on a daily basis and when her dad tells her that she's getting a new computer, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t be happier. Although she likes using it, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the first thing about the specs of a PC. She goes to her tech savvy friend Miriki who shows her the ins and outs of finding a computer that compliments her. This is a story about their daily lives that seems normal but surprisingly amusing."
