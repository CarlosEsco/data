    "en": "A boy, who has never met a girl he wanted to date before, one day runs into a new girl that is entering his circle. He is instantly smitten with her, but he must find a way to get her to notice him. That's a little hard to do, since she's very active and social, has an amazing capacity for drinking alcohol, and quickly finds herself drawn into the wild hijinks of the people around her. Will a day ever come where he can get her attention?"
