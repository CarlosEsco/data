    "en": "Novelist Orihara has had a run of bad luck. He gets 2nd place for his novel, his part-time job's company went bankrupt, and his fiancee cancels their engagement for her boss who she was seeing at the same time. So to get away and relax, he uses the paid trip he had planned with his fiancee alone. Strangely, since the airport, an unknown man has been helping him here and there making him curious as to whether this guy is helpful or actually a stalker. While on the trip, Orihara runs into a man named Jeffrey who laters turns out to also be a novelist. Too bad Orihara doesn't find out that Jeffrey is an active BL novelist until he's being attacked. Luckily, the helping man from before comes to his rescue where Orihara finally recognizes the man as his former fiancee's younger brother Takeru. Takeru finally confesses that he's loved Orihara since his sister first introduced them. Will Takeru's confession be the restart of Orihara's good luck and life?"
