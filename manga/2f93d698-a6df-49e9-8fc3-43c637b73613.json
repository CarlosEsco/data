    "en": "For centuries the Ougi family has been fighting against the forces of evil under the auspices of their patron deity Karura (the Japanese Buddhist derivation of the Hindu Garuda). But when twins are born in the 38th generation, the hereditary powers are divided between them. Shouko has the spiritual abilities of the \u0026quot;Scroll of Heaven\u0026quot; and Maiko the physical powers of the \u0026quot;Scroll of Earth.\u0026quot; Their personalities are just as different, but by joining together they can face any evil."
