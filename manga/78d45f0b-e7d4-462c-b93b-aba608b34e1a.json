    "en": "All humans are wolves in sheep's clothing and the same applies to Douchinji Youichi, a boy who always daydreams about various things, but never says anything out loud. One day, upon seeing a red full moon, a girl came dashing at him before punching him with a silver knuckle, knocking him unconscious and unable to really remember the incident. The next day, a new student, Akatsuki Ayame, joins his class.\r\n\r\nOn his way home, Youichi discovers that the girl who punched him is Ayame, and her silver knuckle draws out what she calls a \u0026quot;wolf\u0026quot;, a person's inner thoughts or desires, from a \u0026quot;sheep\u0026quot;, the superficial mask which restrains the inner \u0026quot;wolf\u0026quot; from surfacing. However, when someone is full of desires and becomes obsessed with their inner thoughts, the \u0026quot;wolf\u0026quot; outgrows the \u0026quot;sheep\u0026quot; and the person will be able to see the World of Red Moon. The girl explains that she doesn't have a \u0026quot;sheep\u0026quot; and would like to have one, so she requests Youichi to become her \u0026quot;sheep\u0026quot;. Youichi agrees to it, marking the beginning of a story of the red riding hood who devours the wolf."
