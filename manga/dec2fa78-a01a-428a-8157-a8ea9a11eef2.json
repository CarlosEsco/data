    "en": "1. Ibuki's type is a rich older man, but why does it always turn out that whoever he falls for is married...? After getting his heart broken yet again by a married man, he decides he's had enough. At work, though, there's an unsociable and somewhat impertinent new hire, Touma, who keeps stealing glances at him. Touma is younger and a far cry from his type, but when Ibuki teasingly asks whether he likes him, his response...?!\r\n\r\n2. To relieve the stress from his job, Houjou requests a 'delivery boy' service, but... the one sent to him is none other than his senpai at work and the very source of his stress, Minato?! Houjou won't let this chance to overthrow his superior slip by!!"
