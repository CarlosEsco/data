   "en": "*Promotion for the novel.*  \n  \nShe wanted to become the head of the family. Laetitia, left in the cold because she was an illegitimate child of the duke, was used as a successor. Her dedication to that was thwarted by Sujin, a foster daughter from that world. Her death was due to false charges. But after her final moments, she wakes up as an eleven year old girl again.  \n  \n‘In this life, I’ll pave my own way forward.’  \n   \n“I’m going to leave the family.”  \n   \nLaetitia rids herself of the forsaken family and heads north. There, she meets the blood-and-iron minded Countess Winter, and offers a deal.  \n   \n“Please sponsor me, Countess.”  \n“What is a duke’s daughter able to do for the Winters, if the Winters shelter you?”  \n“In exchange for a contract, I will undo the curse lying on the Winters’ dominion.”  \n   \nIn this second life, the more she tries to avoid it, the more she gets entangled in these dangerous but enchanting relationships…  \n   \n“Acting as you please. You shouldn’t have saved me, if you weren’t going to look back at me.”  \n“Please leave the archmage, and take me as your husband.”  \n   \nA turbulent second life. Will Laetitia be able to find a new family?  \n\n\n---\n\n[Author's Twitter](https://twitter.com/vine_envi)  \n[Artist's Twitter](https://twitter.com/_Yoteh)  \n[Cover Artist's Twitter](https://twitter.com/MGMG_1012)"
