    "en": "Etoilia, the joyful and prosperous land governed by the goddess Sola.\r\nTowering at the heart this land is \"The Tree of Words\". At the top of the Tree lies the Temple, which shines radiant light.\r\nWith the power to observe other worlds, the goddess Sola noted the everyday lives of the people living in those worlds.\r\nThe books she had written are referred to as \"The Scriptures\", which are loved by the people, and became an object of worship.\r\nThe Scriptures recorded various tales, and through reading them, the people were able to acquire the source of life force, \"Crea\".\r\nWith the Goddess as the center, the world was full of \"Crea\", and Etoilia sustained a great period of peace.\r\n\r\nーHowever, that peace had suddenly collapsed and crumbled away\r\nThe Goddess Sola was sealed away by a certain someone.\r\nWith the Scriptures becoming dull and fading in significance, the \"Crea\" on this world is gradually diminishing.\r\nAmong this anomalous situation, one person and one creature rose up.\r\n\"Lamp\" and \"Match\", who once were servants in the Temple, set off on a journey in order to rescue the Goddess...\r\n\r\nーBy seeking after the legendary summoner."
