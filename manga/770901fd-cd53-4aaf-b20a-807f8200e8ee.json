    "en": "When Makita stopped for a minute and took a look at his life, he was already 28. Graduating from a great college and working hard in the sales department at Elvis Beer, a highly respected company, has brought him success but his life feels empty. Makita realizes he has been missing romance and, without it, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t truly living life. He actively starts looking at women from a new perspective but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what he really wants in a girlfriend."
