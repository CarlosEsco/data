Kosaku realizes he has the once in a lifetime opportunity to get to personally know his dream girl and, together with his group of friends, try to find out why she is here and become closer than just classmates.\r\n\r\nAdaptation of the light novel written by Shiratori Shirow with illustrations by Kippu."
