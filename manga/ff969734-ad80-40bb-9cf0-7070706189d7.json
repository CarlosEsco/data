    "en": "A story of a famous idol talent and his lover and manager of his rival. She's not good at household work, but he likes it and is an expert. One day he decides to stop his idol activity in order to concentrate on his household and look after her, informing her that he has a lover. Good love-comedy. Remark the similarity between this work and Tensai Yanagisawa Kyozu no Seikatsu in many respects - especially in the humour."
