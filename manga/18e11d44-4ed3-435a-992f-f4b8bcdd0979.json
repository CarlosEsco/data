    "en": "Maro is a beautiful goddess who lives a peaceful life in the heavens and uses her water ladle to control the weather at her command. But she clumsily drops it onto Earth and hurries to retrieve it only to find that it was picked up by possibly the worst person it could have been. Kiriko Toshiki seems to be a great kid who is kind to everyone, smart, athletic and good looking, but that is all a fa\u0026ccedil;ade and underneath it all is a sadistic elementary school kid. When he finds the water ladle, his life changes. With the water ladle in his possession, he now controls the weather and Maro is left helpless until she gets it back from Kiriko. But until that day comes, Kiriko plans on teasing and torturing Maro in so many ways."
