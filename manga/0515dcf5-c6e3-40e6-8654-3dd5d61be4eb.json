   "en": "Jinbe is a very subtle and soft tale by Adachi, and certainly it'a story that deals a theme a bit more conflicting than most of his other works.  \n  \nAt first sight, Jinbe is the story of a young 17 years old girl, Miku Takanashi, who lives alone with her step father Jinpei Takanashi (nicknamed Jinbe or shark).  \n  \nJinbe has been living with Miku since his marriage 4 years ago, and considers Miku a God's sent gift from his high school sweet heart late wife. While Jinpei does his best as an over protective and jealous father, we have that Miku holds feelings for Jinbe which are much stronger than the ones an adopted daughter is supposed to have. The main core of the story is to deal how the strong, tender and unrequited feelings of the young Miku put to test their step - father and step - daughter bonds, without jeopardizing any of the happiness that she feels by being close to him as a proper daughter."
