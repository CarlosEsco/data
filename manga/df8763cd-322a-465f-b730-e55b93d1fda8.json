    "en": "Yuki is so ashamed of her figure that she refuses to go swimming, either at school or on the beach. She believes her ribs look strange, and hears that she can have plastic surgery to alter the appearance of her ribcage. Yuki goes to a nearby clinic that performs the procedure, but is told that she must pass a mental health assessment before she can have the surgery."
