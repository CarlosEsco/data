    "en": "Due to his misunderstandings, he makes both enemies and allies angry !\r\n\r\nFrom 「Manga UP!」 (Square Enix), he may be strong but can't be ignored!! \r\n\r\nThe supposedly weakest boy who mastered martial arts and magic, the world shakes his misunderstanding!? \r\n\r\n\"Hmm...I have no talent.\"... is what Yuan grew up in the mountains thinking. He's a normal kind-hearted boy, but of the unusual things about him, is that his parents are a sage and a master martial artist. In other words, the world's strongest. Since Yuan was told he was the weakest, he leaves home to make his dreams of becoming a knight come true. \r\n\r\n\"Eh!? Is it really possible to be defeated with a mere finger-flick by an 8-year-old kid?\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard the hero was the weakest member? You'd have to be out of your mind to fight that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Armies of Angels? You mean the harmful birds? I'll just remove them altogether!\"\r\n\r\nNow, the boy who sees dragons as just lizards you can eat regularly thinks (I am weak. I'll have to get even stronger or else I'll never become a noble knight), will he ever be free from his misconceptions!?\r\n\r\n[hr]Japanese Light Novel: [url=https://bookwalker.jp/series/195888/]Bookwalker[/url]\r\nJapanese Web Novel: [url=https://ncode.syosetu.com/n0774fa/]syosetu[/url]\r\n\r\nArtist Twitter: [url=https://twitter.com/soranoao918]@soranoao918[/url]"
