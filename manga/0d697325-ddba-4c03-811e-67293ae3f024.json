   "en": "Juri has always been saying to herself that she has done everything that she wanted to do, and has lived to her own satisfaction. Plus, she's always been skipping class and coming in late in the mornings, only to be confronted by her class rep, Yoh. Aware of her own situation, she knows that she shouldn't leave any remaining desires and feelings behind…  \n  \nAlso includes:  \n  \n- Santa ni Naritai (I Want to Become Santa)  \n   \n- Koe ni Naru  \nEver since something that frightened her as a child, Suzune hasn't spoken to anyone ever since. For a long time, she always thought to herself that she didn't need a voice, and that there were other ways of expressing her feelings. However, all of that changes when she meets the energetic and talkative Takuya.\n"
