She has an obsessive stalker who's been leaving her creepy messages in her mail box, and her boyfriend dumps her because he got sick and tired of being harassed by her relentless stalker. Just when she decides to move out of her apartment, Natsume, a good-looking guy who reminds her of her ex moves in next door. Can he protect her from her stalker? And what's this about him being in love with her friend?!\r\n\r\nJumping to the Wrong Conclusion\r\nCalled Noe-chan by all her admirers, guys who she became friends with because they weren't her type, she's the cutest girl in school...
