    "en": "1. Nostalgia\r\nAndroids that were used by the military as weapons of mass destruction are now being acclimated to human life. Setsu chooses a female android, Sirius, to foster. Sirius, who has taken so many human lives, must now learn what it truly means to be human. How will she cope with the knowledge that her \u0026quot;foster father\u0026quot; is mortal, while she is destined to last centuries?\r\n\r\n2. Renai wa, Futsuu (Love Is Ordinary)\r\nRira is an adorably angelic high school boy and is insanely attractive to all the other high school boys. Their fascination has ruined his chances with girls, who are jealous of the attention he draws away from them. One day, he befriends a recovering hikikomori girl, who is ostracized by the others for being insanely creepy in a J-horror sort of way...\r\n\r\n3. Akai Mi (Red Essence)\r\nThe prince of a powerful kingdom has killed his parents and invaded the neighboring kingdoms. He is a tyrant of destruction, but he has one dangerous secret. He has a twin sister, who has been kept imprisoned, with no human interaction to comfort or teach her. One day, a sorcerer comes to her and gives her the knowledge and intelligence to threaten her brother's rule...\r\n\r\n4. Na Wasureso (Let's Forget)\r\nTomoya and Harua were close friends as children, and their friendship blossomed into a tentative romance. After the setback of physical illness, Harua appears to be pulling away emotionally. He warns Tomoya that there are rumors that they're gay. Will their connection to each other be strong enough to overcome both physical setbacks and the taunts of their classmates?"
