   "en": "“Women are such a pain. It’s easier to hang out with other guys.”\n\nOur protagonist, a misogynistic high schooler, was run over by a middle-aged woman who wasn’t paying attention to the road while he was on his way to school one morning.\n\nWhen he regained consciousness, he finds himself in an unfamiliar world where he has been reincarnated as Hawk Gold, a woman-loving, obese child of a wealthy family with no morals whatsoever perhaps due to his spoiled upbringing.\n\nHe began keeping his distance from the women who flock to him for money and power, including his beautiful maid, younger sister, and fiancée in this second life he was suddenly forced to live.\n\nBeing born in the ’00s, little did he know that the world he lives in is actually part of “Elements Eleven,” a classic bishoujo game released in the ’90s, and his character was supposed to sabotage them.\n\u003e (novelupdates)"
