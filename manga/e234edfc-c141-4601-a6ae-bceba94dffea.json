    "en": "Ledd is in the most feared prison in the world, but he has no idea of his own crimes. He doesn\u0026#39;t know who he is, nor he remembers his past. A mysterious tattoo on his right hand glows with strange powers. With the wizard Ripp, the beautiful and courageous Drikka and the ogre Horlogh, the young warrior will seek the truth about himself and his origins. But on Ledd\u0026#39;s path is the violent kingdom of Yuden and his hateful military - among them the relentless Colonel Barba Branca."
