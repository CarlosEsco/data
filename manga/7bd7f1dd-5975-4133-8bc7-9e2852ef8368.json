    "en": "Akumajo Dracula: Yami no Juin had in Japan its own comic series that lasted all of two volumes. The comic series of the same name was created in 2005 by company Mediafactory, and it follows events that overlap with bonus-material comic Prelude of Revenge, whose story was conceived by Ayami Kojima; the series is, according to her, a true extension of the of both Prelude and therein the game's actual story. Adding to its authenticity is the knowledge that Koji Igarashi completely supervised its creation.\r\n\r\nThis series was discontinued after two volumes for reasons that were never clarified."
