    "en": "Hase Akihisa was bullied for being an otaku, the chance to change his appearance and start anew in a different school appeared when his father had to transfer.\r\n\r\nGoing around the school, he found a volume of his favorite manga and got so entranced he didn't notice the owner of the manga, Onoozuka Yuu, was right there and saw him on full otaku mode. Akihisa thought he had blown his cover but Yuu was unexpectedly nice to him and they soom became friends.\r\n\r\nAll was well until Akihisa became puzzled by the fact Yuu would randomly kiss him without saying anything."
