    "en": "A collection of stories.\r\n\r\nFrom Hoshikuzuu Scans and Starry Sky Scans:\r\n\r\n1-3. Overtake\r\nFumiya and Kengo are childhood friends with a nine-year age gap. Honor student Kengo is always trailing after Fumiya. Even after he’s become an adult, to Fumiya, he is still like a precious little brother. But ever since he became an exam student, Kengo’s been giving Fumiya more heated stares. In addition to that, he declared, “If I pass my tests, I get a kiss from you”!? Other stories include another two stories about hidden love.\r\n\r\n4-5. Kumo no Ami\r\n\r\n6. Mimic (Imitator)\r\nSatomi is your average older-uke salaryman, a hard worker guy type. When one of his co-worker, Oikawa approaches him, he finds a resemblance between Oikawa and his son -who turned out in the same age as Oikawa. Later when Oikawa invited himself to infiltrate Satomi's house he makes a shocking confession enough to make Satomi falls for him.\r\n\r\nExtra: Over Take Bangai Hen - Futari Kata o Narabete"
