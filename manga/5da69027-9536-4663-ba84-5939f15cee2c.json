    "en": "The distorted memory becomes a masquerade. Everyone hides behind a mask and performs the wildest acts with no consequence. But, life is not a masquerade. The main character is a girl who suffers daily from what she accidentally witnessed years ago.\r\n\r\nShe keeps having flashbacks of a gruesome scene. It always starts with her as a little girl following a black kitten, and suddenly the black kitten turns into a panther! A woman welcomes the panther to join her and the rest of the panthers. And then, unaware of the presence of the little girl, the group starts having \u0026quot;fun.\u0026quot;\r\n\r\nThe girl becomes horrified by the scene. She makes a noise and they notice her.\r\n\u0026quot;Hunt her down! Kill her!\u0026quot; the woman says to the panthers.\r\n\r\nShe managed to escape from the pack, but they got to her parents. In her flashbacks, her parents were chased and fell off a cliff. The authorities told her that it was a car accident. She has lived on the edge of illusion and reality until she sees the photo of the woman on a magazine.\r\n\r\nA photo is all she needs to confirm what her flashbacks tell her. Now, she is ready to get even."
