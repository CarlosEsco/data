   "en": "Manga written by Nemu Youko after she'd given birth to her daughter in 2018, published eight months later. It reflects on her own experience of pregnancy through lives of fictional couple Kiri and Muchan, two people in their 30's with already established routines, careers, and comfortable everyday dynamic, who after years of half-hearted discussions and tiptoeing around the subject find themselves expecting a child.  \n  \nComplimented by a conversation with another mother working editorial in the manga industry, published online.  \n  \n\"This book is for pregnant women, those who were pregnant, those who will soon become pregnant, those who are wondering if they should become pregnant, those who do not want to become pregnant, those who are not interested in pregnant women, those who have pregnant women around, and those who are close to pregnant women This is a book that any person who's been born can read. Thank you.\""
