   "en": "- Kareshi Toshishitakei  \nHer childhood friend, Sou, returns from America for the first time in 5 years. Ai is really happy to see that he has become very angelic looking in the time that they've been apart. However, one day he says, \"I will definitely make Ai mine\", and forcibly kisses her! To get treated like that by someone three years younger than her and who she's always treated as a younger brother takes Ai by surprise. It would definitely make Ai's heart skip a beat, wouldn't it?!  \n  \nAlso included:  \n  \n- Gyakuten Valentine  \n  \n- Kimi ga Hajimete  \nInoue never tells anyone about her job as a voice actor since no one ever believes her. She now keeps it as a secret from everyone around her, but one day she’s discovered by Mukoujima, the womanizer of her class! Why does he keep on visiting her every day afterward?"
