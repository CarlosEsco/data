    "en": "1) Shiranu wa Omae Bakari\r\nYoshikawa Taiki and Komiya Kazuyuki had sex once almost every week, but they were neither lovers nor friends. What started off as a drunken escapade back during a university get-together scaled into something bigger than either of them could have imagined. Though he wished for more, Kazuyuki felt that there was no hope for something deeper between the two of them, because Taiki was as straight as a ruler. For someone like Kazuyuki, who knew that his sexual orientation wasn't generally accepted by society, he planned to give up and stop whatever sexual relationship he had with Taiki. But what\u0026rsquo;s Taiki\u0026rsquo;s say in all this? \r\n\r\n4) Dakara Kao mo Mitakunai\r\nAfter getting dumped, Kataoka Takeru's best friend Yui confesses to him. But Takeru doesn't know how to cope with this situation. What will become of their friendship?"
