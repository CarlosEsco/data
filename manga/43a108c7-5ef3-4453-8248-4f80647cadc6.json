    "en": "Instead of going to work, Ryunosuke, the son of a CEO, enjoys an extravagant lifestyle living off his father's money. One day, a man named Chihiro, who claims to be Ryunosuke's new private secretary, interrupts Ryunosuke's fun and tries to drag him to work. Apparently, he has been commissioned by the CEO and ordered to do whatever it takes to reform the spoiled, lazy Ryunosuke, including keeping him under 24-hour surveillance. Enraged, Ryunosuke begins to heap all sorts of verbal abuse on Chihiro, but to his shock, Chihiro starts to blush... What measures will Chihiro take against the resentful Ryunosuke...? In contrast to his aloof appearance, this super masochistic secretary strikes this misbehaving boy from all angles!"
