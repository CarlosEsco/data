    "en": "Sado Tarou became a masochist, one that feels pleasure from enduring physical and or psychological pain, in middle school when his classmate, Yuno Arashiko, punched him. Now that he has moved up to high school with his friend, Tatsukichi, he wants to get rid of this sexual tendency and live a regular teenage life. He hears about this high school club called the Number Two Volunteer Club, headed by Isurugi Mio. The club is there to advise and help students in various needs and trouble. The only problem is that Mio is an extremely violent and bossy girl, the type of person that treats Tarou terribly and arouses him at the same time. Tarou grudgingly asks for her help to solve his problem but what he doesn't know yet is that his life is about to get really complex."
