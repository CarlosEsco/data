    "en": "Sotoki Keisuke, a high schooler, has never been lucky in his life: he has always been a \"misfortune magnet\". Keisuke wished his misfortune would come to an end, until one day he woke up butt naked to realize a handsome man was on top of him, saying \"Hand over your butt to me!\"\r\n\r\nHe later found out that the guy's name is Mahara, First prince of Latula. Mahara is not a human but a \"magus\". Mahara told him that both of them are a fated pair and that they need to be connected in order for his curse to be lifted, as it was told by the Queen....\r\n\r\nBut this no easy feat, since they're both straight... and only Sotoki can see Mahara."
