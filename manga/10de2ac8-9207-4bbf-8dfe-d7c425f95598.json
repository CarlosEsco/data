    "en": "Kazao is happy with his life on Mirai (\u0026quot;Future\u0026quot;) Island. Sure, his parents abandoned him after he was born, leaving him to be raised at the orphanage-like facility, but his life is comfortable and has his friends, especially the lovely Eiko, the girl he loves. One night, however, he has a horrible nightmare where he sees himself die in a motorcycle accident. After that, everything changes. The next day, his parents are miraculously \u0026quot;found\u0026quot; and he is torn from his idyllic life and Eiko's side to be thrust into a world he knows only from television shows and school assignments. Dropped unceremoniously in the middle of a city with only a sketchy map for guidance, Kazao is saved from wandering aimlessly in search of his new home by the cute and forward Yuu, who turns out to be in his class at his new school as well. Despite his best efforts to accept his parents' sudden return and Yuu's friendly overtures, Kazao can't shake the feeling that things aren't quite right. Nor can he forget Eiko. Why did his parents wait sixteen years to call him back? And why is the piano the only used piece of furniture in his parents' new house? The mysteries begin to pile one atop the other as the lies fall apart in this intriguing story of future possibilities and innocent romance."
