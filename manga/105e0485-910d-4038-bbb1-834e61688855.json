However he has to pay off the mortgage and therefore sees no other way but to look for some housemates.

But not only that, they never take their eyes off him and watch over his education and give him private lessons to save money on the Juku, because a shortage of money blights their life. And as if that is not enough, they try to set him up with Fumitsuki Nanaten..."
