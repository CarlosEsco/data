   "en": "High school freshman Hodaka Morishima leaves his home on an isolated island and moves to Tokyo, but immediately becomes broke because he lacks the identification card and experience to find a job. He faces abuse and difficulty every day, the only bright spot a chance kindness by a girl working at a fast food restaurant. Finally he finds a job as an assistant to an editor he met on the ferry from his home island. Soon after, he has another chance meeting with the girl who had shown him kindness, and a shady character who had abused him at his lowest. Hodaka rescues the girl, Hina Amano, and they run away together. Due to certain circumstances, Hina and her younger brother live together, but have a cheerful and sturdy life. This bright and strong­willed girl possesses a strange and wonderful ability: the power to stop the rain and clear the sky, but at a cost that she does not yet realize."
