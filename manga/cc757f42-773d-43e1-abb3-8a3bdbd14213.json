    "en": "Tired of being timid, school girl Marie wishes she was bolder and more social. To her surprise, two angels appear in front of her. They introduce themselves as Ryofu Housen and her second in command, Chinkyu Koudai. The angels are from Sangoku Heaven where thousands of angels train and engage in war so that they can become king and live lavishly.\r\n\r\nChinkyu is known throughout the Sangoku Heaven as one of the most brilliant tacticians and with the raw power of Ryofu, they make an amazing combo. The two must obtain crystals that appear when a good deed is done for humanity in Marie\u0026rsquo;s world. Marie gets dragged into their quest under the most ridiculous of premises."
