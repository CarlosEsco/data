   "en": "My childhood friend, Magary, was chosen to be the saint. From here on out, she'll have to maintain a smile at all times while at the royal capital and take lessons in etiquette and dance. She'll be living in an excruciatingly stifling world. Having been together since birth, there was naturally one thought in my mind.  \n  \nWhile feeling a little bit of loneliness… I pushed my childhood friend (who was trying to escape with all her might with her arms still bound) towards the knight that came to pick her up.  \n  \n\"Alistaaaaaaaaaaaaar!!\"  \n  \nI feel as if there was some deep resentment in her voice, but that's probably just my imagination.  \n  \nAs her last act of futile resistance, she had me see her off to the royal capital… but, that ended without any problems.  \n  \n\"Now that that's over with, I'll be heading home. Good luck ^^\"  \n  \nI turned my back towards my childhood friend who looked me with deep resentment in her eyes. While I was making my way home… I had to turn around as I was chased by goblins.  \n  \n\"Noooooooo!! Someone, helpppppppp!!\"  \n  \nThis is the misunderstood heroic tale of a scumbag hero and scumbag saint mutually getting in each other's way as they attempt to pursue happiness. [Source: MU]"
