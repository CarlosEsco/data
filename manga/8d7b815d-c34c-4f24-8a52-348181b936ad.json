    "en": "Pompo: The Cin\u0026eacute;phile depicts the craft of movie-making and revolves around Joelle Davidovich \u0026quot;Pompo\u0026quot; Pomponette, a talented movie producer who looks like a girl.\r\n\r\nOperating out of the movie capital \u0026quot;Nyallywood,\u0026quot; Pompo has been shooting one B-grade entertainment flick after another that anyone would enjoy. One day, Pompo's \u0026quot;movie buff\u0026quot; assistant Gene spots a new script written by Pompo and is moved by its exquisite story. In a fit of passion, he proclaims, \u0026quot;I want to see this as a finished work in theaters as soon as possible!\u0026quot;\r\n\r\n However, Pompo tells him, \u0026quot;So you shoot this film.\u0026quot; Thus, Gene takes on his first directing gig. Meanwhile, Natalie, an ordinary girl who just arrived in town with movie actress dreams, has been discovered by Pompo.\r\n\r\n[*][u]Nominated for the 11th Manga Taishou Awards in 2018.[/u]"
