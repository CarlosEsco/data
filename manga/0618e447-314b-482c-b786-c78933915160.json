    "en": "Winner of the 'Minna Erabu!! Digital Comic Books Award' 2019  in the Josei Category.\r\nAdapted into a J-drama starring Mokomichi Hayami \u0026amp; Matsuri Airi. \r\n\r\nSatou Yui is an employee at Amagi Pharmaceuticals. Her beloved  dog  has died and she feels deep sorrow over its death. One day, while drinking at a bar, she shouts, with tears running down her face, \u0026quot;Develop a medicine to bring my dog back to life!\u0026quot; At that time, a man walks towards her. He makes a spiteful remark that there is no such medicine. He also tells her to stop barking and to go home. Yui feels anger within herself and she trips him. She then leaves the bar. Yui is unaware that the man she tripped is Amagi Kyouichi and he is the President of Amagi Pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Yui hears at work that the President is looking for her. When she gets to his office, she realizes the man she tripped in the bar is the President. She thinks that she might get fired, but he suddenly tells her, \u0026quot;Please treat me as your slave.\u0026quot;\r\n\r\nAlternate description:\r\n[spoiler]Following the death of her pet dog that had accompanied her throughout high school, college, and even as she entered employment, Satou Yui was drowning away her sorrows with alcohol at a bar when the man beside her made a grand move to earn himself her malice. \u0026quot;No matter the type of medicine you take, you'll be able to meet your dog quickly as long as you make sure to overdose. If you're averse to the idea, then take some medicine to cure that dull looking head of yours and compose yourself until it's your turn to die.\u0026quot; \r\n\r\nWondering why she had to be told something like that by some stranger, she trips him and causes him to fall. \u0026quot;Sorry, it was on purpose~\u0026quot; While later thinking to herself that she might have overdid it, the man comes looking for her the next day and it so happens that he's the CEO of the company she's employed under?![/spoiler]"
