    "en": "This is a collection of short stories by Suihei Kiki that were serialised in the Seasonal Gangan Powered magazine's 2003 Winter issue all the way to its 2004 Winter issue. Ignoring the tame nature of Suihei Kiki's debut work \u0026quot;Mahou Shoujo Rukana\u0026quot;, Suihei's \u0026quot;Mika ni Harassment\u0026quot; short stories are extremely ecchi in nature for a manga serialised in a shounen magazine aimed towards children. Ecchi to the point that the compilation in March 2005 was jokingly advertised as Square-Enix's first adult manga.\r\n\r\nMika ni Harassment: In the first story, Mika makes a wish on a mirror in order to change the world into one where boys don't have ecchi thoughts when they look at girls. In the second story, Mika's school falls under the control of a misogynic dog who hates high school girls (which includes Mika). Finally, in the third story, Mika raises the ire of six-year-old child genius, Kokoa, who forces Mika to attend kindergarten again.\r\nKasumi Otoko no Ko: A story about a girl called Kasumi who is a tomboy. One day, Kasumi's friend, Haruna, gives Kasumi a Chinese doll that supposedly houses an ancient Chinese goddess of femininity. Kasumi drops the doll into a ditch, which causes the doll to seek revenge on Kasumi.\r\nMahou Shoujo Rukana: A story about a boy named Shuuichi, who has a special power that lets him communicate with animals. One day, Shuuichi moves in with a scientist who wants to study Shuuichi's special abilities. Also, the scientist's daughter is a magical girl called Rukana. Though, Rukana breaks many magical girl stereotypes.\r\n\r\nNote: The author published sequels in form of hentai Doujinshi."
