Even when there were hurricanes, the weather-beaten duo sleep past it. Sometimes when we saved money at a casino, we would jump around on the beds at a resort hotel, only to be broke again the next day. We would walk through deserts, traverse through jungles, conquer mountains, cross oceans– The great detective and her assistant would go through these dazzling adventures–  \n  \nUntil she died.  \n  \nAnd this story starts from 1 year after that incident.  \nI’m the only one who’s left, but I carry on her remained wishes.  \nThis story is far from over.."
