    "en": "The story is set in a middle school in Shishibone city. Tomohiro Miyajima, the main character of the story, and his group of friends are busy studying for an exam. One day, in search for a thrilling mystery as well as easy money, they take several donation boxes and fabricate a curse to scare everyone: \u0026ldquo;Ohone-sama\u0026rsquo;s curse\u0026rdquo;. After scrawling éª¨ (bone) all over the chalkboards and spreading rumors of the curse, the donation boxes are quickly filled and the curse becomes a major legend of the school. Of course, only Tomohiro and his friends knew the curse was fake. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible for anything to happen.\r\n\r\nThat is, until they receive a donation of 50,000 yen and a letter to go with it, reading: \u0026ldquo;Please curse Tanashi Miyoko\u0026rdquo;\r\n\r\nImmediately after that letter, bullying and crimes in the school escalated, strange incidents occur, and Tomohiro and his friends are left with a much bigger mystery than they wanted to have, that they are forced to investigate by themselves. What happened shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have happened. Those who are alive should not be alive, those who know what they know shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to know, and familiar faces are hardly what they seem, but why? And how?"
