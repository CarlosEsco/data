    "en": "Yuuki has had an unrequited love for his friend Hiroya ever since high school time. Hiroya always has a girlfriend, and as a man, Yuuki knows himself out of Hiroya\u0026rsquo;s romantic target pool and so he just can\u0026rsquo;t confess. He planned to stay as a good friend forever. One day, he drank with Youichi, the only one who knows about his love, but the next morning he woke up to Hiroya kneeling before him! Apparently they did it under the drink\u0026rsquo;s influence, but Yuuki didn\u0026rsquo;t have any memory at all\u0026hellip;?"
