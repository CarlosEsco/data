    "en": "Natsuki has struck out at speed dating a bunch of times and doesn't know what to do to improve her luck with men. Then, one day, as she's walking home drunk, Natsuki visits a shrine she used to play at as a kid and prays to the spirit there for a boyfriend... \r\n\r\nWhen she does, a hot and wild-looking guy in a kimono suddenly appears before her and unexpectedly says, \u0026quot;I'll be your boyfriend if you'll have me!\u0026quot; \r\n\r\nSince she's drunk and the guy's also her type, Natsuki doesn't hesitate to accept his offer... but then they're suddenly in her bed at home and he starts taking her clothes off!"
