   "en": "1-2) Hanataba ni Te o Agero  \nFlamboyant doctor who only dates hot guys encounters a shy, bespectacled flower enthusiast who seems quite dull at first glance.  \nDoctor Nakatsukawa and his various family members appear again in La Partita  \n  \n3) Fake Lovers  \nHarajima and Eita have been pretending to be lovers for a year now. Why? Other people are suspecting something might be up.  \n  \n4) Give You the Keys to This Apartment  \nWhen Wataru wakes up the morning after his girlfriend broke up with him, there is a naked man in bed next to him. And he has keys, so he's not easy to get rid of.  \n  \n5) Body Talk  \nWhen Hasumi collapses in the hallway, the much-admired Yasuki-sensei carries him to the infirmary. His cool hands and voice leave a lasting impression on Hasumi, but does the teacher feel anything more for him than he would for any other student?"
