    "en": "Alexander Draco, 12, dreams of only one thing: to return to live in his hometown, Ferrha, a landlocked city on the edge of the Red Valley. Since the age of 5, Draco has lived isolated in the mountains beyond the walls, far from his mother and the inhabitants. The reason, the dangerous anomaly which it carries, capable of damaging any living organism by a simple physical contact. But the appearance of a creature of unknown origin will lead Draco to release a destructive power risking the lives of the inhabitants of Ferrha. Having become a danger to the city himself, his meeting with Aurora will push young Draco to discover the true origins of his anomaly. There is only one way open to him, to join the Defenders against those who have long threatened Ferrha: the Sentinels."
