   "en": "The series is about two forest fairies, Pfil (pronounced as either p'fill, or \"fill\", like the male name Phil, she once corrected another fairy for calling her \"piffle\") and Pamila, who work as hunters and police protecting the forest, though not all of the series feature them as main characters. Pfil is more naïve and innocent, whereas Pamila is more sexually mature and open, although both frequently and easily engage in all sorts of sexual acts. The sexual content varies from intercourse to masturbation, lesbian sex, to fetishism, to bondage, to bestiality (with animals, including birds and insects). The stories often involve the two fairies saving the forest whilst engaging in various sexual acts. The comics often include small educational sections titled \"Pfil’s Educational Comics Corner\", with topics ranging from insect behavior to human anatomy.  \n  \nBondage Fairies was first published in Japan by Kubo Shoten in February 1990 under the title Insect Hunter (インセクト・ハンター), a reference to Pamila and Pfil's role as police officers in the forest. The title was changed in April 1993. The first English translation in the United States used the title Bondage Fairies and was issued by Antarctic Press under their Venus Press imprint in 1994–5.  \nIn the United States, Eros Comix subsequently published four multi-volume series of Bondage Fairies:  \n  \nThe Original Bondage Fairies (Nos. 1-11, 1998–1999)  \nThe New Bondage Fairies (Nos. 1-16, 1996–1998)  \nThe New Bondage Fairies: Fairie Fetish (Nos. 1–8, 1998)  \nBondage Fairies Extreme (Nos. 1-15, 1999–2003) with translations by Toren Smith and Studio Proteus."
