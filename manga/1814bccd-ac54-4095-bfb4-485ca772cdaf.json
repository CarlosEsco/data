During the welcoming karaoke party she took the initiative and sang a song that the director was good at. As a result she was transferred to the show house, which proved to be also the residence of one interesting guy.\r\n\r\nLove Trainer\r\nAsami, who hates dishonesty, often causes troubles in the company where she's working. This time, she gets a client's director angry, and she receives a letter of transfer for the fourth time.
