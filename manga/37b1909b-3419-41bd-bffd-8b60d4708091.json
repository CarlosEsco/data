    "en": "Reki Asubino possesses a cursed mark on his hand. Because of it, neighbors and classmates avoid him; his parents have left him as well. Reki may be the only person left inside the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Mansion\u0026hellip; but he\u0026rsquo;s not alone. He has a lot of servants in his house\u0026hellip; however, they\u0026rsquo;re just not human. He was given as many presents as he would please, but what he really wants is a human companion. One day, he finally gets what he had always wanted inside a box, literally. Though Reki didn\u0026rsquo;t only get a human, but also a caring teacher\u0026hellip; and a dear friend\u0026hellip; or did he?"
