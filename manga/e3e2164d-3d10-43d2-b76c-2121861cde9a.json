    "en": "A high school teacher and a shy unpopular bishounen...\r\n\r\nReturning to his alma mater, Hiyori-sensei is still spending everyday alone. When he hears a rumor about a God of love fulfillment who can \u0026quot;make you fated to be with whomever you want,\u0026quot; he makes the wish to meet his destined one. Afterwards, he runs into a younger colleague, Uzuki-sensei, which triggers an unconscious reaction in his lower half!\r\n\r\nIt turns out that Uzuki is actually a former student that confessed to Hiyori five years ago. Now he's saying: \u0026quot;I still like you\u0026quot;?!"
