   "en": "If you’re tricked by a guy and get reincarnated, would like to become a villainess?\nI didn’t know that I have to teach at a magic academy full of problem children and I even have a son?! Rokuka Shinozaki, a teacher chasing after her stealing boyfriend „I will definitely catch him and get my stuff back!“ was pushed off a bridge and died… \nShe was then reincarnated as the villainess ‚Rika Versin‘.\n\nI have never heard of a woman like her. Not only proficient in literary arts, but also martial arts. A beauty who's the best at punishment magic, a villainess lady who toyed with men only to have them- and the brilliant son who was birthed because of a mistake. In addition, the magic academy, after hearing about Rika's punishment magic, asked her to be a teacher in a class full of problem children.\n\nThe lethargic prince, the evil son of a genius warrior, the reclusive knight of duke's son, the apprentice of royal doctor who loves women, and the youngest prince who is a sweet little devil... How will Rika \"punish\" these problem children with such habits?!"
