   "en": "Sagara, a student residing in Mikazuchi Dorm, has never had any problems finding a partner. After experiencing heartbreak for the first time, it was hard for him to stay at the dorm. As such, he ventures to his childhood friend Hibiki's dorm instead. But as Sagara realized that Hibiki looked like the vice dorm leader – the one who broke his heart – when he wears his glasses, he asked Hibiki to \"comfort me\" as a joke. To his surprise, Hibiki agrees. Drunk in Hibiki's erotic expressions, they have sex. After, Hibiki actually confesses to him, saying he's always loved him!?"
