    "en": "Bok-Qi is a stunningly beautiful girl with an unusually pure heart, albeit lacking in savvy. She has had a life-long crush on Gun-Woo, who came to live with her family when she was a little girl. When Gun-Woo returns to Korea and begins to be involved in Bok-Qi\u0026rsquo;s life again, her candid love towards him begin to have a ripple effect on people around her. Could Bok-Qi and Gun-Woo\u0026rsquo;s relationship develop into something more than a pseudo-sibling relationship? It won\u0026rsquo;t be easy with Gun-Woo\u0026rsquo;s perfection-seeking girlfriend, So-Hyun, in the picture."
