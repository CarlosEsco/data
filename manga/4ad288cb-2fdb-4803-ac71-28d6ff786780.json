    "en": "Noboru seems to have rotten luck at school when it comes to girls, because they all have eyes only for Yuuki, the resident Prince Charming. Tall, dark, rich and handsome Yuuki seems to be the exact opposite of the poor, short and not very manly Noboru. Because Noboru is from a poor family, he had to work extra hard just to get into this prestigious Seihou Academy, which is mainly reserved for the rich and elites of society. Before admittance, it was a dream of Noburo's to hook up with one of the rich girls at Seihou Academy, but his plans seem to have gone awry, especially since all the girls seems to not pay him much attention while doting on Yuuki the most. But for some reason, why does this drop-dead gorgeous hunk, Yuuki, seem to want to get close to him?"
