Her parents died at a young age, and as a doting granddaughter, when she heard about the time her grandmother has left to live from the doctor...!! In order to realize her grandmother's wish to see her in a wedding dress, when she discussed about it with her colleague, Kudou-kun, who happened to find out about her grandmother's condition, he actually said OK?! However, he said that he needed to confirm their compatibility for SEX first... Even though he is usually docile, when it comes to sex, he's intense, rough, and aggressive!!"
