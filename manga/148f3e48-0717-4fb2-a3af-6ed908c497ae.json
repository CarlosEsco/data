    "en": "Order and Chaos are two sides of the same coin. One builds, the other reduces to naught. \r\nOur World isn't made out of only one Universe. There are myriads of others, completely different from the one you know. With their own rules, laws, sciences\u0026hellip; We all coexist in the same World built on a material and immaterial balance. Should there be a disruption\u0026hellip; all the Universes would be threatened. \r\nI am Logos. I was born in order to prevent Chaos. For now, it is at our door."
