    "en": "The guest of a foreign prince, Robert St. Claire is given a beautiful slave for his pleasure. Unusual customs aside, he finds himself in a terrible dilemma. Not only is she English, but the daughter of a friend. In order to rescue her from captivity, he must use her like a harem girl in every way possible...\r\n\r\nLady Syria Davenport has been abducted, sold into slavery, and now finds herself in the bed of an Infidel lord. If she gives him erotic pleasure with subservient eagerness, there is a glimmer of hope in her future. Anxious to escape, she finds that perhaps sexual servitude isn't the prison she once imagined. Besides, every time she gives her lover satisfaction, she receives a rare and valuable pearl as a reward.\r\n\r\nAn English lord and a lovely slave find that circumstance and fate have a hand in granting those rare Arabian Pearls..."
