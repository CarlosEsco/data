    "en": "Sihu Choi, a 2nd year high school student, is famous in his school for 2 things: reading the morning announcements and turning down confessions indifferently.\r\n\r\nAeun Son, also a 2nd year, loves nothing more than to listen to Sihu's soothing voice every morning, often arriving to class late in order to hear the morning announcements in a quiet corridor.\r\nAs the new school year begins and Aeun's obsession flares once more, she makes a promise to herself that she'll become Sihu's friend at the very least.\r\n\r\nWith the help of her older sister, and the fact that they've been put into the same class, can Aeun succeed where every other girl before her has failed?"
