   "en": "1. Burning's Report: Blue Afterglow  \nPeople often say, “Life has meaning only in the struggle.” That is exactly true. Anyone would easily reach that conclusion by opening a history book. No period in human history has ever been free from war. By fighting, people evolve, and by killing… people live. The Immortal 04th Team (minus Chap Adel) makes their appearance in this one-shot manga as they’re tasked with an important mission to investigate an abandoned colony. What they discover there shakes the team to their core. By fighting, people evolve, and by killing… people live. The place where we finally reach the end of that evolution may just be hell."
