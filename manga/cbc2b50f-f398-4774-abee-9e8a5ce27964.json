    "en": "1. Burning's Report: Blue Afterglow\r\nPeople often say, \u0026ldquo;Life has meaning only in the struggle.\u0026rdquo; That is exactly true. Anyone would easily reach that conclusion by opening a history book. No period in human history has ever been free from war. By fighting, people evolve, and by killing\u0026hellip; people live. The Immortal 04th Team (minus Chap Adel) makes their appearance in this one-shot manga as they\u0026rsquo;re tasked with an important mission to investigate an abandoned colony. What they discover there shakes the team to their core. By fighting, people evolve, and by killing\u0026hellip; people live. The place where we finally reach the end of that evolution may just be hell."
