   "en": "Ever since she was a little girl, Hatsuse Nanao has had trouble making friends because she can see ghosts and demons that others can't. She thought things might improve in high school with new classmates, but the rumors have somehow started up there, too. Finding all the stares and whispers uncomfortable, she feigns being sick to skip school for a few days, and runs into a strange little boy at the park who knows her name and demands to spend the day with her. While trying to figure out who he is, she's discovered by Yatou Kaname, her class rep, who lets them stay at his place for the night. Who is this strange little boy and why does Yatou seem to so strongly hate even the idea of sprits and demons? Nanao finds these answers in both her own past and Yatou's."
