    "en": "In the year 2199 a diving mecha gains consciousness, with the help of a Guardian of Atlantis crystal, and declares war on mankind.  Believing that if humans are allowed to live, the Earth will die, the robot builds an army to cleanse the Earth of the human race.  The robot, who calls himself Absolute, also learned how to use the \u0026ldquo;Light of Atlantis\u0026rdquo; power source to raise the city from the depths of the Atlantic ocean, and turn it into a robot city.  There are humans that hold crystals as well, but it\u0026rsquo;s taking all the power they have just to keep themselves alive.  For 100 years Absolute did everything in his power to wipe out the human race\u0026hellip;until the day the first Guardian of Atlantis, Saturn, returned to Earth to reclaim his city.  Upon arriving, Saturn reluctantly teams with the humans to try to defeat the mighty Absolute.  Saturn and the other 5 Guardians, must find a way to reach New Atlantis, and destroy Absolute if they are to reclaim the city\u0026hellip;and reclaim Earth."
