    "en": "At the Ozu Technical High School, students ranging from first years in their teens to fifth years already in their 20\u0026rsquo;s are bred to become engineers. Togawa Sumiji is the president of the Robotics Division and is just as gifted and passionate as all the other nerds in his school. But something about Sumiji makes him stand out from everyone else. And with the robot competition drawing close, it\u0026rsquo;s time for him to shine as the president and lead his members into building the greatest robot in history."
