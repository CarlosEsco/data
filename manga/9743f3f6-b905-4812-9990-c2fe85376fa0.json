    "en": "Iwakura Kazumi is currently down on his luck after his company goes down. While trying to rebuild his business and in need of a place to stay, he takes up the caretaker position at the Maneki Neko Jinja, a small shrine built by his great-grandmother in honor of cats. \r\n\r\nBut he soon finds out that he has to share the space with someone\u0026ndash;or something: three bakeneko who have been living there for a long time, and who seem to know his great-grandmother. Now he has to learn how to deal not only with the three cats, but also with the people who come and go to the shrine."
