   "en": "Helvetica Standard is a random comical short that is self-contained, and generally outside the main story of [Nichijou](https://mangadex.com/manga/188), being a full-color follow-up to the hit manga series. Funny and heartwarming, this two-part series is a humorous look at modern day Japanese design in comic form and a deep-dive into the artistic and creative mind of Arawi Keiichi. Part comic, part diary, part art and design book, Helvetica Standard is a deconstruction of the world of nichijou."
