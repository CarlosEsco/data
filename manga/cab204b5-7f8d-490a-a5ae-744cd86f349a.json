   "en": "Kasumi's father moves around for work frequently, meaning she constantly has to change schools. On one such move, while the two of them have stopped to take a break, Kasumi spots an odd glowing light. She chases it up a tree, but after catching it the branch she's standing on breaks and she falls. When she wakes up the next day, strangely uninjured, she heads to her new school, which turns out to be super exclusive! Kasumi has trouble fitting in with the snobby rich kids in the school, even more so after she gains the ire of the most popular boy in school's fan club, and now she even seems to have gained special abilities!?! How will Kasumi fare in her new school and what are these strange powers that are developing?  \n  \nNOTE: This is an OEL. Not an English translation of a Japanese version."
