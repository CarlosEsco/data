    "en": "Collection of short stories:\r\n\r\n[*] Boku no Himitsu Kimi no Koe\r\nI really, really, really love the famous musician, ASH. One day, in a crowd full of people in town, I find ASH! \u0026quot;If I just got to see him at a glance it would be enough...\u0026quot; that was what my heart was saying while I made my way towards ASH. Without any expectancy, ASH turns around and talks to me. He even asks, \u0026quot;Do you want to be my personal assistant?\u0026quot; I don't believe it! How will my life be after this?!\r\n\r\n[*] Junai Sadism:\r\nIn order to escape the merciless teasings she received as a child, Nanako worked out until she became slim! Just as she gets a boyfriend in high school, her dreams of walking through her new life is shattered as a phony image of her visiting a love hotel is stuck on the school\u0026rsquo;s notice board. Who is this sadistic culprit intent on ruining her love life?!\r\n\r\n[*] Sakuranbo Doumei\r\n\r\n[*] Robo Kare\r\nOur first encounter was in the rain. I was walking in the rain under my umbrella, while he just held his and became drenched with rain water. Our second encounter was in school. I could only describe him as a ROBOT. He was expressionless, even when studying and playing sports. And then people started calling him ROBO...\r\n\r\n[*] Taiyou no Natsuyasumi"
