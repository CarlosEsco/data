    "en": "Being a manga author has always been Yamakawa Nanao’s dream. He even postponed college for two years so that he could pursue it, but when his work that he put everything he has into it is rejected by every publisher, he loses hope. At a below average college and no real direction in life, Nanao meets a fortune teller that leads him to the horse tracks. There, he meets a group of college students, Beniko, Midori, Shun and Soukichi, who form their own winner's circle, a group of people who bet on horses not for entertainment but as a form of income. Nanao has no knowledge of horse betting but his ability to see the smallest of details in the horses shocks the members and he is allowed to join the club. If he plays it right, he could make an extremely comfortable living off of this new found talent."
