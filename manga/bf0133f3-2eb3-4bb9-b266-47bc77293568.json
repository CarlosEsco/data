    "en": "Akito Shinoyama is a detective whose wife died in mysterious circumstances five years earlier, and the case has never been solved. In present day, Akito solves difficult cases with the help of his brother in law, Toma, whom he took under his wing after his wife's death. Toma has supernatural abilities that help him locate missing people, but he can only use his powers if he's in pain. Since he and Akito have developed a romantic relationship, Akito is reluctant to let Toma assist him with his work as it comes with a great cost."
