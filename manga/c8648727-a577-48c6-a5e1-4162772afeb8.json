    "en": "Demian Kawai, who grew up being told by his mother that he is the son of a famous basketball player, became a member of a basketball team. Demian's abilities have earned him the respect of those around him, but after an injury and the mistake in a game, he has lost his confidence. Although he tries his best to rehabilitate himself, Demian suddenly feels as if his upper body is frozen while playing. When he consulted a doctor, he was told that it was a symptom of the \u0026quot;yips\u0026quot;. This is a \u0026quot;rise after the fall\u0026quot; story."
