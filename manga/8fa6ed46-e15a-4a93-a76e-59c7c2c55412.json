    "en": "DMAT, the acronym for the \u0026quot;Disaster Medical Assistance Team\u0026quot;, was first established in 2004. For the past 10 years, the team has been providing on-site emergency assistance at disaster-hit areas. Yakumo Hibiki was an surgeon at the Arisukawa General Hospital's Emergency Unit, but due to a mistake involving his sister Haruko, he has since been transferred to the internal medicine unit."
