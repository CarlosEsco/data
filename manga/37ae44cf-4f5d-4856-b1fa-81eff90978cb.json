    "en": "Kazuomi clones his beloved childhood pets, only to have them return to life in human forms. Having looked forward to the nice low-maintenance cat and dog he remembered, Kazuomi is rather annoyed. After his life is turned upside-down by kindergarten-aged girls with the mentality (and human graces) of your average housepets, Kazuo gets angry and treats them coldly. Will Kazuomi learn to love the fluff again? Will his rival succeed in usurping his place as the coolest guy in school? Will Kureno stop chasing butterflies long enough to accomplish anything?"
