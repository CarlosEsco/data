   "en": "\"‘I was killed by my own fiancé and sister in my previous life. Now, I’m making a strong comeback in this one. Not only do I want revenge, I also want to cause havoc in the entertainment industry. I want to become an A-list producer. Who cares about that scumbag? I want to have all the pretty boys and handsome men.’ \nSome CEO got closer and asked, “Huh? I’m not enough for you?” People think she’s cold and heartless, no one understands her and loves her. But when she saves someone in the heavy rain, her heart starts to melt for him.”"
