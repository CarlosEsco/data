    "en": "One day, a young boy with blonde hair appeared from the other side of the castle walls. His name was Flynn Scifo, and his voice was cold and firm when he said, \u0026ldquo;this has nothing to do with me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\r\nThis is how the two young boys met\u0026mdash;one who never held a sword before, and another who lost his sword, as the two collided, and stirred up the Lower Quarter.\r\nAs the world continued to spread out for the two, there was a wall of reality that stood in their way. Just how did the two overcome this obstacle?"
