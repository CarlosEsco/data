    "en": "A collection of short stories including:\r\n\r\n[*] Hana no Saku Koro (When the Flowers Bloom)\r\nFour years ago in high school, Yoshizawa left a confession letter for Nanba in his shoebox, and asked him for the second button from his uniform if he felt the same way. But he wasn't acknowledged. He's still carrying a torch though, so when Nanba shows up on his doorstep seeking a place to stay for a week, he agrees reluctantly. But only for a week!"
