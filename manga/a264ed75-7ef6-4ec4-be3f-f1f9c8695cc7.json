    "en": "This fantastic story takes place in the incredible Ming Dynasty of Imperial China. Ning Haier is a reckless pirate girl whose father is the leader of Ning Citadel -- the most powerful pirate den of the Southern Sea. One day, Haier led a band of pirates and looted a Spanish ambassador ship while her father was away. There she met a very handsome English man named Michael, who was a very talented translator and an extremely intelligent merchant on the ship. Marveled by Haier's beauty and character, Michael attempts to win over Haier's heart but failed! However, opportunity arose when Haier was captured by the new governor named Shao Zhixun, who vowed to annihilate piracy from China's seas forever. Michael was able to convince Shao Zhixun that Haier is just an innocent maiden who was impressed into piracy... and Shao Zhixun arranged a position for Haier in his own household! Even more interesting, Haier's father captured Michael and planned to collaborate with the charismatic and capable young man, and offered Haier as Michael's bride!"
