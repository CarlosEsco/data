    "en": "Meet Abo Ozawa, ace pitcher. He can\u0026rsquo;t seem to make up his mind, on or off the baseball diamond. Off the field, he finds himself pulled in either direction by two lifelong friends. On one hand, there is the cute-but-fiery Hana Eguchi, who\u0026rsquo;s also an ace pitcher, even more famous, and constantly assaulted by reporters and talent scouts. There\u0026rsquo;s just no controlling this girl. On the other hand, there is the cute-but-controlled Noriko \u0026ldquo;Norippe\u0026rdquo; Asai. The third member of the trio, she finds herself overshadowed by her two friends. As events unfold, will he be able to choose between them?\r\n\r\nBut Abo\u0026rsquo;s mind is on baseball, and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have time to deal with these problems. Or does he? On the pitcher\u0026rsquo;s mound, on the one hand, his left arm has the control to put the ball right where he wants to with absolutely perfect precision. And on the other hand, his right arm is a powerful uncontrolled monster that flails fireballs at the plate too fast to see. Which glove should he wear?\r\n\r\nOn or off the field, he is faced with the decision: right vs. left? In the end, will he be able to choose?"
