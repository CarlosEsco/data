    "en": "For 10 years, the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, was the home port of the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk. But in 2008, Kitty Hawk was replaced by the USS George Washington, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. There have been protests against the deployment of the George Washington in Japan. The Navy's public relations campaign includes a manga that puts a human face on the aircraft carrier. The face belongs to Petty Officer Third Class Jack Ohara, a fictional character who is newly assigned to the carrier as it sets sail for Japan. The manga, titled after the ship's hull number, does not address nuclear safety directly, instead subtly implying that it is a non-issue by having the crew go about their business without any apparent concern on the topic. The real focus is on the day-to-day lives of Jack and his crewmates."
