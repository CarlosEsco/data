    "en": "From PictureBox:\r\n\r\nSugiura Shigeru (1908-2000) is widely regarded as one of the masters of Japanese comics. His 1953 adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans sold over 60,000 copies, quickly establishing him as one of the most sought-after children's manga artists of the 50s. His popularity had faded by the mid-60s, but he made a comeback later in the decade with a number of highly surrealistic, collage-like works, and he chose to rework Mohicans in this new style in 1974. Considered a masterpiece of postwar manga, The Last of the Mohicans is as beautiful to look at as it is a delight to read. This PictureBox edition--the first book-length publication of Sugiera in English--is edited and translated by Ryan Holmberg, who also provides an introduction, and is the inaugural volume in PictureBox's Ten Cent Manga series, focusing on mass-produced genre works in Japanese postwar comics."
