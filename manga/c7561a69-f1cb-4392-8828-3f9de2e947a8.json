    "en": "Takeru Hibino, who is working a part-time job at Ugetsu Bookstore, felt so dissatisfied with the sudden ending of a mystery series that he decided to go to the house of the popular writer, Kazumi Kuon, to give him a lecture. That very day, out of the blue, his body was taken by Kazumi. Afterwards, due to Kazumi\u0026rsquo;s female Editorial Director\u0026rsquo;s secret intention of getting out a new series, Takeru has become a lover of Kazumi. Somehow, while he\u0026rsquo;s still unaware of it, not only his body, but his heart as well has started to fall for the arrogant, yet gentle Kazumi\u0026hellip;!?"
