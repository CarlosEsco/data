    "en": "MADARA tells the story of an apprentice blacksmith in a rural village who gets by using artificial limbs created by his adoptive father. But when a chance encounter with the demon Moki reveals Madara's true destiny, he's catapulted into a mythic quest! His real father, the evil despot Miroku, feared long ago that Madara was destined to kill him and rule in his place. After Madara was born with tremendous powers, his body was cut up, and the parts divided amongst eight evil generals. Now Madara, with the help of a band of freedom fighters and a magical sword, sets out to retrieve his body parts and defeat his brothers, who covet the throne. As he fights his way across the world, he contemplates the prophecy: How will he wrest control of the kingdom from his father and win the people their freedom?"
