    "en": "Very few people know that one of the country\u0026rsquo;s leading erotic novel author is 15 year old Akutagawa Taketo that has just entered as a freshman at Hirameki Academy. Unlike regular high schools, this school only accepts those who are accomplished or geniuses in their particular field, ranging from authors like Taketo to mathematicians or musicians. Taketo feels comfortable being in the presence of other brilliant minds but is afraid that his talent might project as him being perverted. Is Taketo going to be able to keep his secret?"
