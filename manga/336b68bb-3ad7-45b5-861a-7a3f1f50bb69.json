    "en": "\u0026ldquo;Omniscience\u0026rdquo; is a sci-fi graphic novel. Its story is set in a hypothetical future where augmented reality has invaded our daily lives, thanks to contact lenses superimposing virtual characters into reality. One of these characters, Ingeborg, is particularly popular; she is like a second mother for generations of children, devoted and insightful. She is, however, disavowed by more and more of her subscribers \u0026ndash; authorities suspecting her of being more harmful than beneficial to their well-being. This is what two teenagers are going to discover when they help a young fellow from their boarding school to find his parents, who abandoned him a few years earlier for an unknown reason\u0026hellip;"
