    "en": "When Kakeru saves Haruma from a mugger, Haruma becomes obsessed with him. Kakeru thinks he's cute, like a little brother, so he doesn't make much of the situation. However, things turn serious when Haruma asks Kakeru to be his lover. Furthermore, Haruma turns out to be the son of a Yakuza leader! Kakeru tries to politely turn him down, but that's when Haruma gets physical. Haruma's so good, Kakeru might just let him go all the way\u0026hellip;!"
