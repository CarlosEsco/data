    "en": "The witch, Eleonora Asil, has fifteen previous convictions.\r\n\r\nAnd the transmigrator, Noah Park, had no intentions of being involved in the novel\u0026rsquo;s original plot of the dragon beheading the villainess. With that thought in mind, she abandoned her titles as The Wicked Witch and sought to live a long and peaceful life.\r\n\r\nSo she heads down to the countryside wrought with deep remorse for all her misdeeds. And all should be happy\u0026hellip; or she thought.\r\n\r\n\u0026ldquo;Please raise me!\u0026rdquo;\r\nAnd so it would seem that she stumbled upon the heroine\u0026rsquo;s pet dragon \u0026mdash; the black-haired kid that would turn ballistic and obsessive later on \u0026mdash; imprinted the villainess as his mother. And to make matters worse, the male lead suspects her as the prime culprit of stealing the dragon.\r\n\r\n\u0026ldquo;How long should I keep up with you?\u0026rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe thought he\u0026rsquo;d arrest her right away, but seems like the male lead was slowly becoming the dragon\u0026rsquo;s butler.\r\n\r\n\u0026ldquo;Can I hug you?\u0026rdquo;\r\n\u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;\r\n\u0026ldquo;Then\u0026hellip; can you hold me?\u0026rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe villainess believes that the dragon needs a bit of taming.\r\n\u0026lsquo;Oh, male lead, won\u0026rsquo;t you sign a life contract as a real butler?\u0026rsquo;"
