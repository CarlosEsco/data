    "en": "\u0026quot;The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way...\u0026quot;\r\n\u0026mdash;Opening line, The Last Question\r\n\r\nThe Last Question is a science fiction short story written by Isaac Asimov in 1956. The story deals with the development of computers (artificial intelligence) called Multivacs and their relationships with humanity through the courses of seven historic settings, beginning in 2061.\r\n\r\nA personal favourite of the master Sci-Fi writer Isaac Asimov, it is a thought-provoking fiction that even most non Sci-Fi buffs can enjoy. And this timeless classic has been adapted into webtoon format by Ryul, an active illustrator in Ruliweb, which is a Korean web community for subculture fans.\r\n\r\nOriginal webcomic:\r\n[url]http://bbs2.ruliweb.daum.net/gaia/do/ruliweb/family/217/read?articleId=15947372\u0026amp;objCate1=\u0026amp;bbsId=G005[/url]\r\n\r\nThe full text of the original story at:\r\n[url]http://www.thrivenotes.com/the-last-question/[/url]"
