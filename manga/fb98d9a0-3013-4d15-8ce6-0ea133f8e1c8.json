    "en": "No matter how difficult the matter, Oohashi Kazuya wins out with a composed expression. He\u0026rsquo;s the absolute ace of the Sales department. But his true face is that of a worldly-wise man who\u0026rsquo;s a crybaby. One day, when a younger accountant who\u0026rsquo;s made a bad impression, Iwashimizu, discovers his true nature, for some reason he asks him out\u0026hellip;?! For Oohashi, everything is going swimmingly with work and with a perfectly attentive lover, but there\u0026rsquo;s a dark side to Iwashizumi\u0026rsquo;s niceness\u0026hellip;I \u0026rsquo;m happy with only my work, but I won\u0026rsquo;t run away from this love."
