    "en": "I’ve transmigrated into the world of the BL webtoon \u003cIn The House of Dolls, There’s Another Doll Living There\u003e where I left my one and only spiteful comment. On top of that, I become the adopted younger sister of my favorite character: the obsessive male lead who is later regretful for his actions, but still dies along with the duke in the end. So, I was determined. Since I have transmigrated into this world, I can’t stand by and watch my favorite character die. Additionally, I also don’t want to die. That’s why, author, I'll need to change the tags and the ending of this webtoon slightly! From \u003cObsessive Male lead\u003e to \u003cConsiderate Male Lead\u003e. From \u003cSad Ending\u003e to \u003cHappy Ending\u003e. \r\n\r\n“Brother, please smile like that in front of others as well.” I said to Lucian, who doesn’t smile even a little bit in front of others. \r\n“…”\r\n\r\nWas that request too out of the blue?\r\nLucian looked at me with a peculiar expression. \r\n“If you do that, I will give you a gift.”\r\nI said that because I wanted to help him in anyway I could. \r\n\r\nHe looked at me for a bit and hesitated before replying, “A gift… Is anything fine?”\r\n“Of course!”\r\nThe moment I gave that answer with certainty, his expression changed right at once to that of a starving predator... Did I make mistake?\r\nThen, Lucian calmly replied with an expression full of expectation. \r\n\r\n“Give yourself to me, Rachel.”\r\nHuh? What did he say? What did he just ask for?"
