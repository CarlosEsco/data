   "en": "Akira is set in the post-apocalypse Neo-Tokyo of 2030, a vast metropolis built on the ashes of a Tokyo annihilated by an apocalyptic blast of unknown power that triggered World War III. The lives of two streetwise teenage friends, Tetsuo and Kaneda, change forever when dormant paranormal abilities begin to waken in Tetsuo, who becomes a target for a shadowy government operation, a group who will stop at nothing to prevent another catastrophe like that which leveled Tokyo. And at the core of their motivation is a raw, all-consuming fear: a fear of someone – or something – of unthinkably monstrous power known only as…Akira.  \n  \nWon the 8th Kodansha Manga Award for Best General Manga.  \n  \nSee [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=375) for the anime movie."
