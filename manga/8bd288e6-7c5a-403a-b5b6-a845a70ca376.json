   "pt-br": "Cross Game de Mitsuru Adachi, conta sobre a história de Koh Kitamura e suas quatro vizinhas, as irmãs Tsukishima, especialmente Wakaba e Aoba. A familia de Koh possui uma loja de artigos esportivos e a família Tsukishima tem uma cafeteria com um centro de rebatidas. Wakaba (uma das irmãs Tsukishima) e Koh nasceram no mesmo dia e no mesmo hospital e são amigos desde pequeno. Wakaba trata Koh como o seu namorado, para o desdém de Aoba, que é bastante ciumenta devido sua adoração pela irmã mais velha, nutrindo assim um certo ódio de Koh. Mas quando ocorre uma reviravolta do destino, suas vidas são completamente mudadas, e assim Koh ganha um novo sonho: ir para o Koshien."

He made his manga debut in 1970 with Kieta Bakuon, based on a manga originally created by Satoru Ozawa. Kieta was published in Deluxe Shōnen Sunday (a manga magazine published by Shogakukan) .\n\nMitsuru Adachi is well known for romantic comedy and sports manga (especially baseball) such as Touch, H2, Slow Step, Miyuki and Cross Game. He has been described as a writer of \"delightful dialogue\", a genius at portraying everyday life, \"the greatest pure storyteller\", and \"a master manga artist\".

However, after Mitsuru became famous, his brother's work still did not improve, and finally died of illness. Therefore, Mitsuru respected his second brother Tsutomu very much, and often depicted the image of friendly brothers in his manga.\n"
