They receive a proposal from the divine fox spirits, the latter claiming that they will protect the rabbits if they hand over a beautiful bride. However, since there are no girls of a marriageable age, Rikka, the rabbits' head son, decides to go talk to the divine foxes. What he did not expect was that the head son of the foxes, Shirou, would fall in love at first sight with him. How will these two opposites get along? Can a fox really love a rabbit?  \n  \n5-6: Ai ga Areba Daijoubu (If There Is Love, It Is Alright)  \nA salaryman goes through too much stress at work – as a result, he ends up addicted to sex. Since women can be problematic, he chooses to go to a gay sex agency. There he meets Haruki, who easily sneaks into his everyday thoughts."
