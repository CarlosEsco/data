   "pt-br": "Antes de Berserk se tornar o que é agora, Miura Kentaro criou um capítulo protótipo para o manga. O ano era 1988 e ele ainda era um estudante na época. Este é o one-shot protótipo em que a manga Berserk é baseado.",
   "uk": "Це ваншот, створений Майстром Міурою 1988-го року. Хронологічно його можна було б розмістити після арки «Чорний Мечник», однак, він неканонічний, оскільки є чимало розбіжностей із иншими арками, на кшталт «Чорного лицаря» замість «Чорного Мечника». Однак, цей ваншот є важливим, адже він визначив подальший наратив «Берсерка»."

In 1977, Miura created his second manga titled Ken e No Michi (The Way to the Sword), using Indian ink for the first time. \n\nIn 1988, Miura bounced back with a 48-page manga known as Berserk Prototype, as an introduction to the current Berserk fantasy world.\n\nIn 1990, a sequel was made to Ourou titled Ourouden that was published as a prequel to the original in Young Animal magazine. In the same year, the 6th issue of Monthly Animal House, the first volume of the solo project Berserk was released with a relatively limited success. Miura again collaborated with Buronson on a manga titled Japan that was published in Young Animal from the 1st issue to the 8th of 1992, and was later released as a stand-alone tankoubon. Miura's fame grew after Berserk was serialized in Young Animal in 1992 with the release of \"The Golden Age\" story arc, and the huge success of his masterpiece made of him one of the most prominent contemporary mangaka. At this time, Miura dedicated himself solely to work on Berserk. He indicated, however, that he intended to publish more manga in the future.\n\nMiura provided the designs for the Vocaloid Kamui Gakupo, whose voice is taken from the Japanese singer and actor, Gackt.\n\nKentarou Miura died on May 6, 2021 due to an acute aortic dissection at 54 years old."
