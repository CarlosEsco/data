Yakou was left to run his father's rare book store and bitterly resents it. Then a super-hot babe walks into his store. She's a \u0026quot;book-detective\u0026quot; and tells him she's taking over the store so Yakou can pursue his family's heritage--the \u0026quot;other job...\u0026quot;.\r\n\r\n3) is 'Full Scratch Eiji,' about a boy who tries to get away from his otaku past. He was a legend among figure makers, \u0026quot;E-Model-san,\u0026quot; until a girl rejected him for being too \u0026quot;otaku.\u0026quot; Yoshizaka is easily the big man on campus; adoring girls throng about him. Jealous boys chew their livers. Then he stops to help a goofy girl--who is thrilled to meet \u0026quot;E-Model-san\u0026quot;! She could ruin everything; he has to shut her up!\r\n\r\n4) is 'Otone no Naisho,' a story about a young samurai girl who finds herself the owner of a perverted possessed katana."
