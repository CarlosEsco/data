    "en": "Kaoru was an aspiring mangaka, with big dreams and (what he thought was, and still does think,) oodles of talent. Now he's just another hikikomori (recluse) who hasn't left his room in 5 years...Until one hot summer night, when he hears, from some distant place, voices which call him. Voices that only he can hear. Voices that are calling for help. Following the voices, Kaoru opens the windows, and steps out into the night."
