   "en": "Luciano, a complete idiot, tried to make some money playing mahjong despite not knowing how the game worked at all. Of course, Luciano lost a lot of money because of this (don’t make bad decisions guys). He was going to ask his dad to help him get the money back, but his friend/mentor, Ru, stopped him from doing it and told Luciano to fight for himself. This led to Luciano asking Ru, his dad, and some other guy who’s just there to be the fourth player and to be hot, how to play riichi mahjong.  \n  \nAnd you get to learn it too, and/or criticize how Luciano was taught how to play it (constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated)  \n  \nThis is mainly for my friends/family who are new to riichi mahjong, so I don’t implode from having to teach people over and over again."
