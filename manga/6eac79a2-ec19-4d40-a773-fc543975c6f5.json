    "en": "Sometimes, all it takes is a little fall for you to see the world around you differently. When Louis is magically ensnared and driven off a cliff by Maxie, a ruthless vampire hunter, he wakes up only to realize that the woman who was determined to kill him a moment ago has replaced her memory with the impression that the two of them are engaged. Louis must decide whether to tell her the truth and risk paying with his life, or end up marrying a notorious, cold-blooded killer whose old memories could return to her at any moment. A little white lie couldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt, right? Especially not when your life is on the line."
