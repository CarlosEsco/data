   "en": "Stress, obesity, baldness… Tackle any parallel world person’s health problems with a delish!  \nA registered dietician, Asayama Touya suddenly got sent to another world together with his little sister one day.  \nAfter that, He stumbled upon a restaurant called \"Healthy Kitchen\", and found out that \"all healthy food\" tastes bad in that world…   \n  \n\"A tasty, yet healthy food is just a pure fantasy.\"  \nThat's what most people in Miliasky thought, the country where a Registered Dietician, Asayama Touya found himself transported to.  \nEven though he was lucky enough to be sent to a world with good public order, and didn't have any trouble procuring any ingredients nor cooking tools. Since science research didn't really advance well there, the concept of \"Nutritional Balance\" wasn't really well received there, which in turn made them think that it's normal to eat whatever they like.  \nBut then, he found a restaurant called \"Healthy Kitchen\", the only place that seems to serve \"food that's supposed to make you healthier,\" in a world with such loose views on nutritional balance.  \nHowever, what actually served to Touya, who anticipated some awe-inspiring another world food, was something that is far from what he expected…  \nWith his Dietician Knowledge as his weapon, will this ex-office worker be able to turn around the entire norm in the another world!?  \n  \n-Source: Bookwalker"
