    "en": "Stress, obesity, baldness\u0026hellip; Tackle any parallel world person\u0026rsquo;s health problems with a delish!\r\nA registered dietician, Asayama Touya suddenly got sent to another world together with his little sister one day.\r\nAfter that, He stumbled upon a restaurant called \u0026quot;Healthy Kitchen\u0026quot;, and found out that \u0026quot;all healthy food\u0026quot; tastes bad in that world... \r\n\r\n\u0026quot;A tasty, yet healthy food is just a pure fantasy.\u0026quot;\r\nThat's what most people in Miliasky thought, the country where a Registered Dietician, Asayama Touya found himself  transported to.\r\nEven though he was lucky enough to be sent to a world with good public order, and didn't have any trouble procuring any ingredients nor cooking tools. Since science research didn't really advance well there, the concept of \u0026quot;Nutritional Balance\u0026quot; wasn't really well received there, which in turn made them think that it's normal to eat whatever they like.\r\nBut then, he found a restaurant called \u0026quot;Healthy Kitchen\u0026quot;, the only place that seems to serve \u0026quot;food that's supposed to make you healthier,\u0026quot; in a world with such loose views on nutritional balance.\r\nHowever, what actually served to Touya, who anticipated some awe-inspiring another world food, was something that is far from what he expected...\r\nWith his Dietician Knowledge as his weapon, will this ex-office worker be able to turn around the entire norm in the another world!?\r\n\r\n-Source: Bookwalker"
