   "en": "\"Long, long ago, humans lived almost the same as beasts… If you got hungry, you could just find something to kill and eat it. If someone attacked you, kill them too. Everything was kill to survive, kill to survive. Then people started acting smart and making laws. The laws kept them from doing pretty much everything they wanted to do. Beasts, on the other hand, still have no laws, or etiquette. I predict the day will come when an almost mutant breed of humans will appear, sinking to the level of beasts for freedom… Here, I will call them *Vampires…*\"\n\nTezuka's parody of Shakespeare's Macbeth. \n\nNOTE: Has a 4th volume that collects the second part of the story. However, Vampires never finished, as the magazine it ran in suspended publication."
