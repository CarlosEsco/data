Anxious, Melmo's mother in heaven asks God to prepare some magical candies, and hands them to Melmo.  \nThere are two kinds: Melmo can grow 10 years older to become any sort of adult she wishes by eating a blue candy. By eating a red one, she can become 10 years younger.  \n  \nUsing these miracle candies, Melmo disguises herself as a nurse, schoolteacher, policewoman, and overcomes troubles together with her brother, Totoo."
