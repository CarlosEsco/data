    "en": "The Kitauji high school wind instrument club had at one time participated in national tournaments and was a champion school, but after the club's adviser changed, they have not been able to even participate in the qualifying tournament. Under the strict leadership of Taki, a substitute for Ms. Rikako, they steadily build up their strength. As they fight over who plays solos, some students give priority to studying and quit club activities. Finally, the long wished-for day of the contest arrives."
