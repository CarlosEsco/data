However, he witnesses Koutarou, number one popular guy in school, in a scene showing his free-spirited nature regarding relationships, and Kazuomi's heart trembles in pain.\r\n\r\nA riajuu senpai that can't stay long in a relationship and an innocent kouhai who doesn't know love \u0026ndash; their sweet, melting youth begins."
