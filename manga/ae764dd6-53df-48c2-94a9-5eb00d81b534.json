   "en": "Olympic track star. MIT whiz-kid. Adored by the beautiful co-ed's. Revered by classmates and teammates alike. Yu was sitting on top of the world.  \n  \nThat is, until the evil seductress Payetta, leader of an outlaw gang of boozers and brawlers, kidnaps Yu at knifepoint and steals him away to her hideout. He learns he's actually the son of Gilgamesh, the legendary founder and ruler of the ancient yet highly advanced civilization of Agartha. The history lesson doesn't stop there, though. Payetta claims to be the granddaughter of Adolf Hitler and wants to share her maniacal dreams with Yu and the new dystopia she plans to create."

     "en": "Associated Names: IKEGAMI Ryouichi, อิเคงามิ เรียวอิจิ, 池上辽一, 池上遼一\n\nBirth Place: Fukui-ken, Takefu, Japan\nBirth Date: May 29, 1944\nZodiac: Gemini \n\nIkegami began drawing his first comic series at the age of seventeen. Even then, Ikegami had the magic touch, and his first two collaborative efforts - I UEO Boy with [Koike Kazuo](https://mangadex.org/author/785c1506-618e-4829-9533-86995c04c0a4/koike-kazuo) in 1973 and Otoko Gumi in 1974 with [Kariya Tetsu](https://mangadex.org/author/4279ea10-bc91-47f9-b7a7-aca12bc4430f/kariya-tetsu) - proved so popular they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators and shows no signs of stopping.\n\nHe worked at [Mizuki Production/Mizuki Shigeru](https://mangadex.org/author/9a7709d7-c9a6-4afb-bdf9-054aec977140/mizuki-shigeru) as an assistant for about a year and a half. He is a fan of [TSUGE Yoshiharu’s](https://mangadex.org/author/0495ec83-5f94-4b89-af30-5db3238581f1/tsuge-yoshiharu) works, Ikegami was surprised when he saw Tsuge also worked at MIZUKI Shigeru’s place.\n\nIkegami once applied to be an assistant to [SATO Masaaki](https://mangadex.org/author/ec701ae7-65a4-4fcc-884c-bee29d3baaac/satou-masaki) \u0026 [SAITO Takao](https://mangadex.org/author/bc302292-841c-42b1-962d-bcb41d427ae2/saito-takao) but they already had enough assistants at that time.\n\n[FUJIWARA Yoshihide](https://mangadex.org/author/d4bd7c05-4986-424a-99d1-30d7d56daa95/fujiwara-yoshihide), [Akiha @](https://mangadex.org/author/4a3fbf8e-d386-400b-b167-7eb729c44e3d/akiha), MATSUHISA Yuu, and SATA Misaki were once his assistants.\n\nSource: [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=930)"
