   "en": "Microids are a being between humans and insects- while looking human, they can sprout wings from their backs, are equipped with extraordinary powers, and are barely the size of your finger. However, they are enslaved under Gidoron, who plans to take over the human world and destroy the polluting humans above.   \n  \nYanma, a Microid, manages to escape, along with Ageha and Mamezo, who make their way to the city to tell humans about Gidoron's plan. The only ones who take heed of his warning is Dr. Midoro and his son, Manabu. Meanwhile, Jigā, Yanma's brother, leads the attack on humans."
