    "en": "It is currently the Obento era, when humanity's home cooking skill has risen to such a level that specialized powers for cooking, called Tools, have begun to manifest in people.\r\n\r\nNishinomori Shizuru's mother, an extremely famous cook, disappeared when she was young, leaving her daughter with only a promise to meet again and a single kitchen knife. In an attempt to find her mother's whereabouts, Shizuru enrolls in a bento cooking school reserved for those with Tools, despite not having any powers of her own.\r\n\r\nShe gets challenged to a cook-off with her place in the school on the line, and well, turns into a magical girl.\r\n\r\nMight have a crying loli or two."
