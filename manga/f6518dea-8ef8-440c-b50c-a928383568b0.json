    "en": "\u0026quot;You were my closest and dearest friend but I fell in love with you. There is no way out. You are very precious to me, but I know that I can't make you happy.\u0026quot;\r\n\r\nIzumi Seita, a gay, introverted and pessimistic high school student, falls in love with Shinoya Taichi, his best friend. Shinoya is the complete opposite of Izumi: he is cheerful, reliable and has a girlfriend. Before Izumi leaves for university, he gets his only chance to hold Shinoya. The sex they had seemed like a dream... But Izumi absolutely refuses to ruin his friend's life and decides to try and forget about his feelings, even though it makes him miserable. What's more, Shinoya won't accept his decision. It's an awkward love when you can't even tell your beloved about your feelings..."
