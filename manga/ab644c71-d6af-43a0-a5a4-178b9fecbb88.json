    "en": "Naoshi decides to present his work to a publishing company, where he meets the eloquent and prince-like editor, Nikaido. But contrary to his looks, Nikaido can be pretty hard and he heavily criticizes and dismisses his work.\r\n\r\nA few years later \u0026ndash; Naoshi is now aiming to be a popular manga artist under the sadistic guidance of Nikaido. During that time, it seems that his unexpected skinship with Nikaidou has left his heart slightly disturbed... ?!"
