    "en": "Zhian Tian was abandoned by his father along with his mother and sister. They moved to East China Sea to earn a living, but his mother was murdered and framed to look like a suicide jump off of a building.. Fortunately, a mysterious person rescued him and took him to join the army. After ten years of bloody battlefields and fighting bravely to kill enemies, Zhan Tian ascended from being a border pawn, all the way to being called 'The God of War'. He lead the iron cavalry under his command to sweep borders, guard territories, drive out the barbarians, and set a world-leading feat. Ten years later, he received an imperial edict and returned to Beijing to report on his duties. Finally, he had the opportunity to make everyone tremble under his feet."
