But she's so afraid he'll reject her that she hasn't made a confession yet, even to this day. She wants to be close to him, but she can't manage to do more than just joke around with him. What will become of Serena and her wish for love!?\r\n\r\n2) I Want to Get Lovey-Dovey!! (Rabu-rabu ni Naritai!!).\r\n\r\n3) Love Is Invincible and Ultimate\r\n\r\n4) Your Girl Possession\r\nSequel of My Boy Possession\r\nIt's Christmas, and Serena is excited about the idea of being alone with Kacchan on Christmas Eve because she wants to give him all her body and soul... until her friend gets dumped by some guy because \"relationships turn cold after you go all the way.\" Now Serena's having second thoughts...!?"
