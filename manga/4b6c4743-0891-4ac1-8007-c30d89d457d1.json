   "en": "This is a world where humans and vampire has found something to co-exist: Artificial blood. Still, you can't really helped that people would be scared of vampires bec. of their dangerous nature. Meanwhile, a man (uke) who is tired of loneliness (death of lover) decided to adopt a vampire child. OFC, he had needs so he calls in for sex service every night. What he didn't know is that the kid sees it and because the kid drinks his blood, he is growing up too fast. Will MC (uke) be able to see this vampire as a grown man when he was just an adorable little child yesterday?  \n  \nDoujinshi: This is about after Joel and Raine pass over a little difficult change and how they overcome it with the power of love.  \n  \n*Recommended reading order: First manga, then doujinshi.*"
