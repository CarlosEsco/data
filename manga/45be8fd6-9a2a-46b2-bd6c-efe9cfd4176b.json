    "en": "A shriek was heard as a sailor uniform skirt fluttered, and Meguru thought himself a lucky perv till he caught a glimpse of... a guy's boxer shorts? \u0026quot;Quit staring, old fart!\u0026quot; By chance, he ended up inviting the high school boy in a girl\u0026rsquo;s uniform, Keiichi, to his place with the mystery of why he wears that uniform still unsolved. Unwittingly, however, Meguru discovered the reason behind Keiichi's uniform... Two hearts entwined and a tale of first love, to reach out to get closer to your heart. \u0026quot;That uniform, are you wearing it 'cause you really want to?\u0026quot;"
