    "en": "Night Raid is a band of assassins who work covertly to cleanse the Capital, a place where greed and corruption runs rampant. Mercilessly killing those who perpetuate its evil, Night Raid aims to help the innocent and pave the way for a better tomorrow.\r\nWhile Sheele is training Tatsumi in the forest, the two happen upon a young girl being attacked and save her. The girl, called Nea, cannot see or make her way alone, and they end up taking her back to Night Raid's hideout. Tragic circumstances have forced Nea to seek out her remaining family in the Capital, and having taken a shine to the girl, Sheele resolves to help her. However, with the Capital being the swirling pot of avarice and malice it is, Nea's troubles are far from over.\r\nAt another time and place, Night Raid sets their sight on a new target: a group of deadly assassins indiscriminately killing civilians for sport. As Night Raid prepares to deliver retribution upon the culprits, Bulat finds an unexpected dilemma in this routine mission.\r\n\r\nAkame ga Kill! 1.5 was originally released as a special 100-page bonus volume bundled with the limited editions of the anime Blu-ray/DVD volume 1.\r\nIt contained two side story chapters about Bulat and Sheele, and the opening pages contained a crossover with [url=https://mangadex.org/title/8056]Isshuukan Friends[/url].\r\nIt was rereleased as a standalone tankobon on December 25, 2017, with two new chapters."
