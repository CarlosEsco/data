It's because I can't help but worry about the beautiful human, Mariya, who has the same face as the cute devil Maria who has been humbled. I want to get closer to him somehow. I want to do that too...! Nonetheless, Kamiya is a stubborn sword. On the contrary, he said, \u0026quot;I'm not a killer.\u0026quot; The word \u0026quot;killer\u0026quot; is shocking to him, who is Osigoto to bring a human being to his life. Mr. Shinigami, who has been making outstanding achievements in the world of Shinigami so far, makes a certain decision in order to dispel the image of \u0026quot;Shinigami = killer\u0026quot; that Kamiya holds. Second volume of \u0026quot;Nakimushi Devil Maria-kun\u0026quot; series! \r\n\r\nRelated Series\r\nNakimushi Akuma no Maria-kun (Adapted From)"
