    "en": "Yukimura got kicked out of home because he was the son of a mistress and his dad passed away. After going abroad to cope, he then applied for this job to be a waiter at a resort. Yukimura pictured fancy bowties, music, and trees by the poolside. However, day one he finds out he’s working at a traditional Japanese inn with a rather cold boss. It seems that people who work at the inn have nowhere else to go… \r\n\r\n(A Nakai is typically a female profession at a traditional Japanese Inn. They tend to the guests, do housekeeping, carry luggage, make meals, host events, and more. It’s a female profession because it’s said that they provide the care and attention that only women have.)"
