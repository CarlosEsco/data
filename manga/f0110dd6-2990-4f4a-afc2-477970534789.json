   "en": "A collected and corrupted world, everything works, exactly as planned. When the 'incident' occurs, the Old Mafia is mysteriously taken down by a legend only known as KING, the world is free from their almost tyrannical rule. It's been 15 years since the incident, KING has disappeared from the world, only being mentioned in old stories, the world has began to corrode and crumble once again thanks to conglomerate powers influencing every major tragedy and event in the world, increasing food shortages, inflation, debt, stemming from the secretly corrupt government, ruled by King Zhettley, and the recently assembled New Mafia, ruled by the ruthless Mortem Canis, without KING, there was no fear incentive, no hero to beat the villain.\n\nIt started with one man, Trevor J. Tommy, a villain in every meaning of the word, to infect the poor and unaware Ricky Antanomy, a 9-5 conformist, average worker of a law firm, an ant compared to the world, with a task. To dismantle the government, and to end the damned mafia, for the greater good, if you can call it that."
