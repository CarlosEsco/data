    "en": "Shine\r\nPhotography club member Maki takes ordinary pictures, instead of exciting ones. A simple-minded and innocent girl, she has a hard time voicing her feelings, like her crush on teasing Doujou sempai. Her quest to take more interesting pictures leads her to a boy who always speaks his mind. Drawn to his bluntness, Maki's feelings are becoming a lot less simple!\r\n\r\nSlowly My Lovely.\r\nFuuka Nishikawa is a people pleaser who has unexpectedly been confessed to by classmate (and space-cadet) Tokuda. Since she barely knows him she's unable to give him an answer, which doesn't faze him in the least. When a sloth at the zoo reminds her of Tokuda, she finds herself envying their laidback approach to life and talking to the sloth about her thoughts and feelings. Which is totally, totally normal.\r\n\r\nBefore the Promise\r\nA broken ski lift leaves Yui Mishima stuck in the air with abrupt and straight-forward guy Hisashi Kono. Intrigued by his unusual personality she continually seeks him out, until her trip is cut short and she has to leave without saying goodbye. Two months later he's still on her mind, when she bumps into him at train station!\r\n\r\n\r\nA night to be Perverted ( omake) The author recounts a night of women sitting around watching porn, and how it all goes terribly wrong."
