   "en": "\"The boy I love is dead.”  \nYuugen is a sickly, high school boy with zero motivation in life. He avoids interacting with his classmates, and lives an utterly bland and colorless life. However, there’s always one boy who always calls out to him every single day. That’s Hideto, upbeat and outgoing, loved by anyone and everyone. To this bright individual, Yuugen harbors feelings that he has not told anyone.  \nHowever, one day, Hideto suddenly passes away. While still grappling with the reality of the situation, Yuugen discovers that the ghost of Hideto has appeared before him. Bound to this world by unfinished business, he enlists the help of Yuugen to help him pass on, but…!  \nA summer of love for two boys to purify the soul.  \nA bittersweet love story of a boy overcoming grief and taking the steps into adulthood."
