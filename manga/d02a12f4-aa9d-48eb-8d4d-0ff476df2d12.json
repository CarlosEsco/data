   "en": "Nina is an orphan who lives in the slums with Korin and Saji, two brothers who are orphaned like her. She hides her identity as a girl and goes by the name Ninaf so that she wouldn't be sold as a slave due to the rare colour of her eyes despite the fact that there are pedophiles who are also into guys. She goes to steal for Korin who is sick and at death's door, gets beaten up and subjects us to a weird victimisation monologue (one that had nothing to do with the situation of her friend as well as the few panels before it where she gets beaten up) about how her eyes are different from everyone else's and how she's alone. Korin dies and Nina is sold by Saji. She is bought to become the substitute for a conveniently dead princess who conveniently shared the same rare eye colour. In three months, she is to learn the mannerisms of a noble and will be married off to a prince of another country."
