    "en": "Ogawa Chiaki is a YouTuber with a channel where she cleans and processes wild game her father has hunted. With the income, she is funding an impossible dream, the dream she has had ever since she was little, and the one she has never given up despite the opposition from all around her, except for her childhood friend who works as her cameraman.
