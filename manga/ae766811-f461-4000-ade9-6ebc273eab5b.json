    "en": "When an enemy explosion leaves private military soldier Terawaki Ryo nearly dead, a secret organization rebuilds his body using the research they have done in human revivals. Unfortunately for him, the technology only allows him to come back in the form of a teenage girl. His new identity, Shibahara Kyoko, leaves him distraught as his frail body doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for the combat skills he used to have or even pick up heavy artillery he used in the combat field. Kyoko is assigned to protect a prestigious academy where daughters of powerful leaders attend since the girls\u0026rsquo; presence makes it a hotspot for terrorists to attack and blackmail the people in power. Led by his former commander and mentor, Major Honjo who has also been reborn as Ryo, was a beautiful teenage girl named Chujo Shizuko, and the pair work together as anti-terrorist teenage school girls."
