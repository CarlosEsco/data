   "en": "This is a shounen manga about a senior named Taketo Iwase and a dog named Salsa. As they set off early on to resolve a problem with a criminal that Toshifumi (Taketo's brother) is having, Taketo sees that there is more to the dog (that can communicate in the human language) than meets the eye. Together they solve a number of troubles and also meet other different species (cat girls, dogs, birds, etc). The author clearly shows that she is capable of drawing dynamic illustrations, especially in the fighting scenes although it make look somewhat shoujo at times. Wild Half has some very funny gag lines, some moving plots, helpful morals, in short, a little bit of everything packaged into one."
