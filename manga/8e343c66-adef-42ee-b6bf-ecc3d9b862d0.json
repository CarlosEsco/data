   "en": "The Iyahaya family, one of Japan's most prominent conglomerates based in Iyahate Prefecture, has decided to take care of a relative named Nantomo while his parents are transferred overseas. Iyahaya Sayoko can't help but be curious about her relative's boy of the same age. What kind of boy is this eccentric Nantomo?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a boy in a tattered coat appears before Sayoko's eyes, a poorly dressed eccentric person who eats his dog's food. When she asked him what his name was, he said, \"Iyahaya Nantomo (Oh no... I don't know...)\", how unclear. Sayoko and her grandmother hurriedly invited him into their house, convinced that he was their relative, Nantomo.\r\n\r\nEven though he is not Nantomo, the head of the Iehaya family, Totetsumo, decides to keep the poor, mysterious boy as a Nantomo and sends him to Kenkin Academy, the same school as Sayoko.\r\n\r\nThe school is in the state of Cold War with The Hatesate family conglomerate and Iyahaya Family conglomerate. With the arrival of Nantomo, the school is dragged into a great explosion of madness."
