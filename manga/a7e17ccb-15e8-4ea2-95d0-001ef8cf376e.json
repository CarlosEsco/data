    "en": "Welcome to your mind! Nio has an unique demonic ability which lets him fight enemies in their own mind - these are fantastic, sometimes bizarre places without any strict rules. Whoever wins such a duel can steal an ability from the opponent. But such a mighty abilty comes with a price. With every Mind Game Nio risks his own health, maybe even his life. Can he gather enough strong abilities to face his archenemy, the great Demon Kaiser - or will he fall victim to his own special power?"
