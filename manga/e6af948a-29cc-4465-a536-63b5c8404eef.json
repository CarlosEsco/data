One day, she's chatting online when she meets three classmates who hate school as much as she does. Together, they hatch a plan to blow up the school when no one is present. The countdown is on for X-Day …  \n  \nSide story: The Last Supper  \nIn the future cows have died out and are now made using human DNA. The can speak and look similar to humans, but people still eat them and treat them as cows. After her father was eaten, Lamda the cow decides to run away. Unfortunately he is caught, but before that he helps a little boy, Mitsuhiko. The boy then insists Lamda become his servant instead of being eaten. When the Black Plague hits Mitsuhiko he is in danger of dying because the only cure is cow's meat and every cow except Lamda is gone…."
