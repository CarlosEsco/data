    "en": "\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to become the best comedian out there!\u0026rdquo;\r\nAfter making this promise with his grandma, Asahi sets out to attend a comedy vocational school. And on his first day, he gets unexpectedly partnered with another guy for his acts. And that guy is Minase, a very good-looking, but sarcastic guy. They were very reluctantly paired together for their bit, but ended up hitting it off. They hit it off SO well, that they got carried away and kissed each other during the bit! \r\n\r\n\u0026ldquo;Pair up with me.\u0026rdquo;\r\n\u0026ldquo;I want to work with you too.\u0026rdquo;\r\nAnd this is how the rag-tag duo began. Put together the level-headed tsukkomi with the rambunctious boke to get a bickering couple in a comedic BL!"
