    "en": "Because of an unaccepted mariage, Norika has only had his parents for family. Unfortunately after his mother had passed away, he had to grow up on his own and to take care of his ill father.\r\nYet, after 15 years of silence, here comes the brother of his mother asking Norika to come and sign in a school located on an island while he would be staying with his father.\r\n\r\nBut the drawback of this school is that it is divided into two parts : wealthy people and not wealthy people. Hence the strong rivalry that has been born and ruled by the president of the students : Norika's cousin, Yuusuke."
