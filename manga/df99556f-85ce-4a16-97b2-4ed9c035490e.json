   "en": "This is a collection of short stories that Tezuka wrote about transformation and its many forms.\n\n(From DMP): \nThe world is nothing but a series of metamorphoses, from changing who you are internally to be a better person to the actual act of growing from a baby to an adult to the elderly. In the world of Osamu Tezuka, transformations show the darkness of humanity. One machine turns humanity's cast-offs into easily-hunted prey. A dancing farmer is turned into a put-upon vagrant only supported by his cat. A giant oaf turns out to be the sweetest and effeminate best friend you could hope for.\n\n[Official English, Print in August 2022](https://www.amazon.com/Metamorphose-Osamu-Tezuka/dp/1569703760/ref=sr_1_12?crid=6ZRCOE6IKD7X\u0026keywords=Metamorphose\u0026qid=1652292764\u0026s=books\u0026sprefix=metamorphos%2Cstripbooks%2C60\u0026sr=1-12)"
