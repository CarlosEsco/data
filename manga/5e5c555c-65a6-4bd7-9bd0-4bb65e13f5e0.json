   "en": "This sci-fi story depicts humanity's fight against the super bio-chip, \"Gaso\" (\"Our Origin\") in the near future. Gaso is a new type of bio-chip that is able to multiply through iterated learning and memorization, and has begun to metamorphose after becoming self-aware. However, upon discovering that it was emitting dangerous radiation as a byproduct of its reproduction, the government ordered that the project be terminated.  \nOne member of the research group, Dr. Higure Tsukimitsu, took out Gaso and went into hiding. After that, a single word began to display itself in databases around the world: \"version\". Oosawagi Shirou, a researcher who held the Doctor in high regard, comes seeking the help of private detective, Happou Mitsuru, to locate the doctor's whereabouts…   \n  \nDark Horse published 2 volumes, out of 3."
