    "en": "In a series of tales that dance between warring clans and clandestine meetings, take a step back hundreds of years to the Jishou Era.\r\nThese are the days where a beloved musical instrument can bring the emotion out of an ascetic monk for his young ward; a tasked assassin will fall in love with his target and lay his life down on the line for his prey, while devouring him in more intimate ways; where the pages of history are too scandalous that one must be careful not to be taught with in class, after all.\r\nWhen the war rages in the background, men will find comfort with those that they have sworn to protect; they will find appreciation in the simple niceties that have been offered to them, as well as the camaraderie and companionship with those they trust their lives."
