    "en": "Keita Itou\u0026mdash;a boy with no special qualities other than superb luck\u0026mdash;suddenly receives an acceptance letter from the renowned all-boys Bell Liberty Academy (a.k.a. BL Academy). Attracted by the school\u0026rsquo;s prestige, he decides to attend. However, on the day of his transfer, he gets into a freakish traffic accident. Luckily, no one is injured...but the incident arouses the attention of both the Student Council\u0026rsquo;s president, Tetsuya Niwa (a.k.a. the king), as well as the head of the Budget Council, Kaoru Saiyonji (a.k.a. the queen).\r\n\r\nKeita works to discover the reasons behind his invitation to such a remarkable school, struggles to find his niche among such brilliant and beautiful young men, and attempts to win the school-wide contest that will grant his wish of permanent placement at BL Academy! Along the way, he develops intense relationships with the rest of the hunky characters: clever Naruse, the captain of the tennis club; pensive Shinomiya, the captain of the archery club; sensitive Iwai, the captain of the art club; spunky Taki, a cyclist; cold and calculating Nakajima, the vice president of the Student Council; genius computer programmer, Shichijo; the childlike teacher, Umino, and the friendly but mysterious classmate, Kazuki Endou.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]In the Gakuen Heaven series:\r\n\r\nVol. 1: Gakuen Heaven\r\nVol. 2: Nakajima Hen - Closer to You\r\nVol. 3: Tanba Hen\r\nVol. 4: Endo Hen - Calling You\r\nVol. 5: Shichijou Hen - Sweet Sweet Darling[/spoiler]"
