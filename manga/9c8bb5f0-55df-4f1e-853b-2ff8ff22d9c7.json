    "en": "Keita Itou—a boy with no special qualities other than superb luck—suddenly receives an acceptance letter from the renowned all-boys Bell Liberty Academy (a.k.a. BL Academy). Attracted by the school’s prestige, he decides to attend. However, on the day of his transfer, he gets into a freakish traffic accident. Luckily, no one is injured...but the incident arouses the attention of both the Student Council’s president, Tetsuya Niwa (a.k.a. the king), as well as the head of the Budget Council, Kaoru Saiyonji (a.k.a. the queen).\r\n\r\nKeita works to discover the reasons behind his invitation to such a remarkable school, struggles to find his niche among such brilliant and beautiful young men, and attempts to win the school-wide contest that will grant his wish of permanent placement at BL Academy! Along the way, he develops intense relationships with the rest of the hunky characters: clever Naruse, the captain of the tennis club; pensive Shinomiya, the captain of the archery club; sensitive Iwai, the captain of the art club; spunky Taki, a cyclist; cold and calculating Nakajima, the vice president of the Student Council; genius computer programmer, Shichijo; the childlike teacher, Umino, and the friendly but mysterious classmate, Kazuki Endou.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]In the Gakuen Heaven series:\r\n\r\nVol. 1: Gakuen Heaven\r\nVol. 2: Nakajima Hen - Closer to You\r\nVol. 3: Tanba Hen\r\nVol. 4: Endo Hen - Calling You\r\nVol. 5: Shichijou Hen - Sweet Sweet Darling[/spoiler]"
