    "en": "Kouda\u0026rsquo;s job in Tokyo didn\u0026rsquo;t go well and now he lives as a cafeteria worker back in the country side. One day, he meets Nojima, who moves into the neighborhood, and becomes close with him, but finds out he\u0026rsquo;s the leader of the notorious Nojima group! But contrary to his reputation, Nojima asks Kouda to eat with him every day, and he can\u0026rsquo;t seem to sleep by himself because of the rumors that ghosts might appear in his house."
