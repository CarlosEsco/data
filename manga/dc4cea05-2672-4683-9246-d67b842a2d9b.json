   "en": "Masaki Tsuji is a divorced high school teacher in his early 30s. Lately, he's been running into a groper on his train ride to work. At first, he thought it was a mistake, but once the hand reaches around the front, things start to escalate! Then a voice whispers, \"You're cute, Mr. Tsuji.\" He can't stop thinking about the perpetrator all the way to school. When Sohta, a student who usually gets good grades, hands in a blank test sheet, Masaki calls him in for a talk. They meet after school, and once Sohta confirms that they're alone, he goes in for a kiss! Sohta whispers to a panicking Masaki out of the corner of his mouth, \"Have you been getting groped on the train recently?\" Sohta ties him up and starts playing with his body…! This is a secret school love story between a handsome student and his 30-something teacher!",
   "pl": "Rozwiedziony nauczyciel ze szkoły średniej, Tsuji Masaki, napotyka na nieoczekiwany problem – staje się celem zboczeńca w metrze. Początkowo myśli, że intruz myli go z dziewczyną, ale w chwili, gdy zboczeniec celowo łapie go za cenne klejnoty, a do ucha szepcze Psorze, jesteś taki uroczy, jego przypuszczenia legną w gruzach. To opowieść o szkolnej miłości, gdzie bohaterami są przystojny licealista i jego nauczyciel."
