    "en": "Genji is the youngest son, and heir to the Kamatani tea house. In the shadow of two successful brothers, he struggles with how to make the traditional tea house a success with younger people. Then one day, his grandfather shows him a precious object, a beautiful tea caddy of an intricate wooden design, made by the son of a craftsman in the neighbouring town. Genji is inspired and implores his grandfather to make an introduction, to propose a collaboration between the two businesses. When he finally meets the handsome and imposing creator of the tea caddy, he has a shocking response to Genji\u0026rsquo;s request!"
