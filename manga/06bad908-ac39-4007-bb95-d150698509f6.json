    "en": "From MangaHelpers:\r\n\r\nThis manga contains four short stories about boys in love with girls.\r\n\r\nIn Boy's Room, Taku has conflicting feelings about his older sister's friend, Aoi. \r\n\r\nIn Je t'aime, Etsu's cooking skills may be insufficient to win the heart of the girl he likes. \r\n\r\nIn Vintage, Ken is a popular guy, but he may have missed his chance with the girl he likes. \r\n\r\nIn Baby Boys, Takasugi meets a girl who wants to be tough, but he sees her as a cute girl."
