    "en": "Ogata, a serious salaryman, is said to have had a blemish free life throughout his school years and into his working life. He was an honor student who would pay attention to his surroundings and, without exception, would not allow for prejudices to be made as he believed that one’s hands should be extended to save the weak.\r\n\r\nHis co-worker, Ayase, feels irritated by this. His hatred becomes stronger as Ogata waves his ideals of justice over his head. He uses a new employee (and prostitute) recruited by the company's president, named Kamiya, and devises a plan to deceive Ogata."
