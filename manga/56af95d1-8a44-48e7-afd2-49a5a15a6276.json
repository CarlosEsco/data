    "en": "Nobo and Her? by MOLICO ROSS\r\n\r\nInvisible but cute? Sweet life with a ghost girlfriend \u0026hearts;\r\n\r\nRumours are flying around college that Yasuhisa Nobo has a new girlfriend\u0026hellip; but no one has ever seen her?! The heart-warming tale of the (for some reason?!) popular Nobo and his invisible ghostly girlfriend♪\r\n\r\nFrom the Editor:\r\nThe \u0026ldquo;ghostly girlfriend\u0026rdquo; is never drawn anywhere in the manga. Instead, she communicates by writing on a whiteboard, and by moving various objects in the room. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how much of her emotions really come across, without ever seeing her! You\u0026rsquo;ll discover just how cute she is \u0026hearts; She only exists in each reader\u0026rsquo;s imagination, as the ideal girlfriend. Read this once, and you too will fall in love with her too♪\r\n\r\n[b][*]Note:[b] [url=https://www.manga-audition.com/comic-zenon/nobo-and-her-by-molico-ross/]Official English[/url] is halted, with latest ch 17 release on 12/25/2016. No announcement plans were made for continuing the English releases."
