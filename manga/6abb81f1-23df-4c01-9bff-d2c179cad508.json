    "en": "1) Happy Cook\r\nChef Nakasawa saves Tokiya from trouble and ends up teaching him how to cook. But is it only cooking that Nakasawa will be teaching?\r\n\r\n2) Straight Mind\r\nIncoming freshman Kasuga has always won any fight he has been in, until he meets the elusive Tougou. Kasuga wants nothing more than to meet Tougou again and fight, but he is told to stay from Tougou. It seems that Tougou is the chief director's son, and a previous student was expelled for hurting Tougou. Can Kasuga stay away? Will Tougou allow anyone to get close to him again?\r\n\r\n3) Happy Place\r\nStray dog... stray uke... Does it really make a difference?\r\n\r\n4) My One-Sided Love\r\nKazuki is a game programmer who collects adult toys. He's also been in love with his neighbor Masato for ten years. When Masato asks Kazuki to teach him how to use a computer, will the time they spend together be all work and no play?\r\n\r\n5) Restriction\r\nTsukasa may look scary with his piercings and blond hair, but the straitlaced head of the disciplinary committee is the frightening one! He ruthlessly uses Tsukasa who's trapped! But sempai will graduate in a year, then Tsukasa will be free, right?\r\n\r\n6) Special Lunch\r\nWe go back to our original couple from ch 1 and a new type of dinner date."
