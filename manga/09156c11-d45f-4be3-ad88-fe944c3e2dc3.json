   "en": "Ai was just a girl minding her own business when she met him. He was so poor and down on his luck that he couldn't even pay for his own meal. Ai took pity on him and decided to treat him for lunch. What should have been a fairly innocent meeting with him, turns rather strange when she decides to take him home and give him a place to sleep. That should have been all, since he left very early in the morning and nothing unfortunate happened…but is it possible? After how long of a time will she see this beautiful boy again?"
