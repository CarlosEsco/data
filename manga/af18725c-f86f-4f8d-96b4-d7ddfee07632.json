    "en": "1-3 \u0026amp; 7) The Scent of Temptation\r\nShina works part-time at a caf\u0026eacute; as well as a flower shop. Most days a Kanae, a salaryman and the brother of the flower shop owner, comes to have his coffee at the shop. One day a man is with him, and Shina realizes from watching their interaction that Kanae must be gay, which comes as quite a shock.\r\n\r\n4) When I Grow Up\r\nWhen Tokiwa-san met Hiroto, he took to him because he looked so much like his dead lover. They become friends, but is that all Hiroto is to him, a substitute? And what role does Satoru, Hiroto's \u0026quot;friend with benefits,\u0026quot; play in all of this?\r\n\r\n5-6) The Fields in Which We Live\r\nTakamori took in Nagisa when he was hurt, but that wasn't the end of Nagisa's troubles. His boyfriend abuses him, and Takamori just found a gay porn video featuring Nagisa. Takamori isn't gay, but he worries about Nagisa and can't get him out of his head."
