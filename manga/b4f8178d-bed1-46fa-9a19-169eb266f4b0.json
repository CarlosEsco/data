    "en": "Just before her return to England, Holly discovers in her luggage the valuable painting she had sketched earlier. She had become entangled in an unthinkable crime... She was deceived by a man she trusted! Jumping on to a train bound for Rome, she runs into a compartment in the first-class carriage. There, she encounters Matteo, a sharp justice who immediately realises she is on the run. However for an unknown reason, he does not hand her over to the police, and instead takes her back to his mansion. As he confiscates her passport, she starts to worry about what lies ahead..."
