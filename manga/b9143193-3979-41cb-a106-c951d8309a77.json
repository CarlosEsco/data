At first he plans to leave it in storage; however, his house is soon invaded by multiple groups of people after the briefcase. Although still not knowing the purpose of the briefcase, Tomoharu and Misao attempt to escape with it.\r\n\r\nFrom there on, Tomoharu tries to learn the secrets behind the briefcase, the connections between it and Misao, and why it has the power to change the world.\r\n\r\nAnimeNewsNetwork Links:\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10380]Season 1[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10932]Season 2[/url]"
