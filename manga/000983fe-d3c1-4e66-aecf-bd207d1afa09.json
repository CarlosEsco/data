   "en": "During that time, I might have been dead had it not been for video games. Because so much time has passed, I can finally talk about it…This is an auto-biographical manga about my video game-centered youth! In \"Boy's First Love,\" I tell the story of the girl with whom I bonded over a mutual addiction to video games. In \"Candy Shoppe Boy,\" I describe the utopia that was that old candy shoppe. Where is that shoppe now? \"Boy in Line\" is the story of my harrowing night spent outside a game store waiting in line to buy Final Fantasy V. Where is my soulmate? Find out in \"Sentimental Heart Boy.\" Where was my favorite place to play games on a rainy day? \"Secret Castle Boy\" answers that question. All stories are true!!  \n  \n(Source: Jmanga)"
