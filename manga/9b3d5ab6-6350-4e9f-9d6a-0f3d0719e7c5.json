    "en": "Ignacio DaSilva is a world famous Brazilian karate expert turned soccer player who has been making headlines. His giant body and unusual speed has made him the number one player in the world by far. During his post game interview, he stated that there was someone with more talent than him and that he was coming back from Brazil any time soon. This left the media in a frenzy to find who this player was that was better than the great Ignacio.\r\n\r\nKensho is the son of a karate master who grew up with his next door neighbor, Satsuka, who was the daughter of a soccer coach. As fate may have it, Kensho became a great soccer player and moved to Brazil for 3 years while Satsuka stayed in Japan and became the scholastic champion in her division. Kensho comes back to Japan and attends the same high school as Satsuka. Little does the world know about the tornado that was about to hit the soccer community with the return of Kensho."
