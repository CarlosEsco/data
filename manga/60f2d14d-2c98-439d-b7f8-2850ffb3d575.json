    "en": "Story 1) Having grown up together in the same apartment building, Hasumi and Souichirou are like brother and sister. But one day, Souichirou suddenly confesses to Hatsumi! They start going out, but their story is filled with the confusion of first love.\r\n\r\nStory 2) Rainy Day Children: Rumi is a very bored 3rd grade girl. What can one do when all it does is rain, rain, rain? The answer, of course, is to go outside, enjoy the rain\u0026ndash;and just maybe, find an interesting new friend.\r\n\r\nStory 3) Love Machine: Natsuki has a crush on a boy a year younger than she is. She thinks she can find the courage to confess, if only he would see her as a girl instead of just his senpai.\r\n\r\nStory 4) The Sun Adventurers: Legend has it that beyond the two mountains in the west where the dark forests ended, there was a place that could make wishes come true\u0026hellip; People called it: Sunlight. Tulip, a young female of the Persian tribe, has a very important wish\u0026hellip;\r\n\r\nStory 5) Fly into the Blue Sky: A young girl learns to fly\u0026ndash;but not too high.\r\n\r\nStory 6) Awful Boy: Miwa knew Takumi already had a girlfriend.
