    "en": "Sakae, a young man who works hard to treat his sick brother, is abducted by a suspicious man just before surgery. The place where she was taken was a closed lonely tower ... and many traps were set in it, sinking to the bottom of despair. But a more terrifying opponent than a trap attacks. The battle begins without understanding the purpose and identity of their so-called \u0026quot;Mogly\u0026quot;. The only thing I understand is that their bodies are so similar to \u0026quot;ares\u0026quot; ... I have to return to my brother's recovery. Which is the best choice in the extreme?"
