    "en": "The story begins in the near future, where a social mobile network called the \u0026quot;Kizuna-Topia\u0026quot; (Bonds-Topia) controls all communication and surveillance in the wall-bound city.\r\n\r\nIn this city, two sisters, Enna and Yayako, come face to face with the ongoing man-hunt for young, healthy children. The kidnappers take these kids to the white tower to extract their brains and sell their bodies. This man-hunt, led by the local police known as the \u0026quot;Jikei,\u0026quot; is counteracted by the mysterious being only known as \u0026quot;The Witch.\u0026quot;\r\n\r\nEnna, Yayako, and other residents of this city are trapped between the ongoing conflict between the Jikei and The Witch."
