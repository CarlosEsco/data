    "en": "\u0026quot;We need money for your bedridden mother. So please, work at the Royal Palace!\u0026quot;\r\n\r\nThis is what the daughter of a Count, Muriel, was told by her father one day, which she firmly refused.\r\n\r\nThat's because she's a shut-in whose weakness is socializing, simply immersing herself in books. No way am I going to work at the Royal Palace!, is what she thought, but her father proposed she work as a librarian. Thinking that she might be able to work there if it's that, Muriel immediately went for an interview, but--\r\n\r\nWhy is she being interviewed by Commander Silas who exudes sensuality!? And why is it that when she came to, she was already employed as the \u0026quot;Sacred Beast Caretaker,\u0026quot; someone who takes care of the sacred beasts!? A very popular work from Ichijinsha's Iris Collection!!! The long-awaited comicalization of the Sacred Beast love comedy between a shut-in lady and the commander of the Sacred Beast Order!!"
