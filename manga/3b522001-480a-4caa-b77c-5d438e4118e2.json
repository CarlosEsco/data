    "en": "Ichijou Seiya is a young prodigy who is the manager of the Teiai underground casino and the creator of the diabolical pachinko machine \u0026quot;The Bog.\u0026quot; Before his fight to the death with his nemesis, Itou Kaiji, he had a youthful period when he was still smoldering and unable to make anything of himself. The story is set in Ooyama, Itabashi, Tokyo, a \u0026quot;bog\u0026quot; that has swallowed up the dreams, hopes, and despairs of young people, and is about the ambitions and difficulties of freelancer Ichijou and his younger colleague Murakami who move into the capital and live in a tiny apartment."
