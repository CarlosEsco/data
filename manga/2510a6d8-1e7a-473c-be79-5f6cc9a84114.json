    "en": "\u0026quot;If you don't like it, tell me fast... or else I won't be able to stop.\u0026quot; He whispers sweetly in her ear, caressing her with his fingers and tongue... Was he always this animalistic!?\r\n\r\nMasumi's life is busy with school and work, as she repays a debt left to her by her family. One day, she faints from fatigue, and the one who rescues her is Satoru, a childhood friend who now lives a luxurious life, completely different from the past. Realizing the difference between their positions now, she figures he must've forgotten their past together... but then he suddenly pushes her down! \r\n\u0026quot;Aren't you the one who forgot?\u0026quot; \r\n\r\nAlso, for some reason, she ends up living with Satoru and his stepbrother. Living in close quarters with two hotties is too stimulating... Her heart can't handle life with these first-rate men!"
