   "en": "Tabi is traveling to a town to meet her Childhood friend, \"Kou-chan\", on a train. When she arrives, she meets an Officer, Nishimura, and an energetic young man. Yukita; both are which surprised that she came on a train that has never come before. Shortly after arriving, she discovers this town isn't ordinary in the least, and has a puzzling problem. Certain roads in the town will try to \"eat\" people by randomly falling into a deep pit, the town resets after each day, making the same events as the previous day occur, and the townspeople don't notice anything out of the ordinary, forgetting each time; the exceptions being Tabi, Yukita, and Nishimura."
