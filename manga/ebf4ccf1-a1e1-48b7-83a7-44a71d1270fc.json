   "en": "Midorimaru Matsunoki, the only son of lord Matsunoki Mumeharu, retainer of Hideyoshi Toyotomi, becomes involved in his father's secret plans about construction of a new castle. Soon after encounters a female peasant school teacher, Tae, who becomes his lover. Circumstances even come to affect the beautiful female noble Yayoi, who hates (and loves) him, and his beloved sensei, samurai Fujinosuke Murasaki, the main constructer of the castle, in ways no one would have anticipated…  \n  \nThis is a fast-paced story with overt characterization that reflects on the fairness of love and war.\n\n[Official English](https://emanga.com/collections/osamu-tezuka/products/the-castle-of-dawn)\n\n---\n**Volume 50 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
