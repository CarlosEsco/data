    "en": "Urara is a modern day Cinderella living with a wicked aunt, instead of a step-mother. Her friends convince her to go with them to Shibuya in hopes that they will meet a popular model named Yuki. Her friends spot a fake Yuki and Urara is run over by a mob of fans. She looks up to see another good looking guy in front of her. He suddenly styles her hair and looks at her. Astonished, she knocks his sunglasses off and realizes that it is the real Yuki. Later on, she has a fight with her relatives and packs her bags. With no where to stay, Urara has no where to go...and then she sees Yuki again...is he the answer to her problems?"
