    "en": "Mukai Taiyo is a junior high school student who supports his family, comprising five members, together with his mother who is running a small local restaurant. At first, he earned money by secretly betting on golf games. After helping a member of his school's golf club, however, he began to practice golf hard in order to become a professional player. The hero's persistent character along with his physical constitution helped promote the image of golf as a familiar sports event. To hit a tee shot well, Taiyo always calls out \u0026quot;Cha Shu Men\u0026quot; (Chinese noodle with slices of baked pork), which became a popular expression at the time."
