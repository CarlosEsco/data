    "en": "Ore x Yome (chapter 1-3): Himekawa is 26 years old and has a beautiful girlfriend who wants to remain a virgin until she's married. He's lied to her and told her that he has a career with a company when in fact he works at the local convenience store. Ashamed, and wishing to power up his career so he has a shot at actually marrying his girlfriend (and her virginity), Himekawa replies to a want ad and is surprised to get an immediate response.\r\n\r\nGyakushu no Ore x Yome (chapter 4-6): Kou's very good with computer science and robotics, but not very skilled with the opposite sex. He has a crush on his coworker, Moe, but he hardly even speaks to her. Then one day, his 99 year old self from the future sends him back a present; an android of Moe that only wants to make him happy. His future self comes along for the ride, in the form of a little phallic robot. His new penis-bot and android girlfriend are definitely going to make his life a lot more complicated."
