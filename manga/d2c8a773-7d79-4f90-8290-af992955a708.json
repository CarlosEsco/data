He borrowed some of his personal belongings while also dropping various hints which made everyone think that there was something intimate going on between them.  \n  \nGiven the Yu Clan’s powerful authoritative presence in the imperial court, this layer of relationship allowed Zhong Wan to live a much better life than before indeed.
