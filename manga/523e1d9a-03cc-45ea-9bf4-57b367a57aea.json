    "en": "From [url=https://thelazylittlepeach.home.blog/]Peach Kyoudai[/url]:\r\n\r\n\u0026ldquo;I... want to be friends with you, Matsumoto!\u0026rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn the present day where humans and werebeast are living in harmony, there is something that has been bothering Matsumoto, a Kishu weredog, who actually likes cats. It's about a male calico cat that kept appearing when he was feeding the cats near the school as part of his daily routine. And\u0026hellip; there's also the fact that he finds Sasaki, a student from the same seminar, to be cute.\r\n\r\nOne day, he found out that Sasaki is a werecat as well as that calico cat. And from then on, he can cuddle and pet Sasaki\u0026rsquo;s cat form all he wants! But the more time they spend together, the more Matsumoto\u0026rsquo;s feelings for Sasaki go in a direction other than friendship...\r\n\r\nThis is a fluffy sweet werebeast love story between a quiet Kishu weredog who likes to take care of others and an honestly sweet werecat who start out as friends.\r\n\r\n[b]Note: To avoid DMCA since this title is still ongoing, we will only release the first chapter for public[/b]"
