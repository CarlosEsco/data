   "en": "From [Peach Kyoudai](https://thelazylittlepeach.home.blog/):  \n  \n“I… want to be friends with you, Matsumoto!”  \n  \nIn the present day where humans and werebeast are living in harmony, there is something that has been bothering Matsumoto, a Kishu weredog, who actually likes cats. It's about a male calico cat that kept appearing when he was feeding the cats near the school as part of his daily routine. And… there's also the fact that he finds Sasaki, a student from the same seminar, to be cute.  \n  \nOne day, he found out that Sasaki is a werecat as well as that calico cat. And from then on, he can cuddle and pet Sasaki’s cat form all he wants! But the more time they spend together, the more Matsumoto’s feelings for Sasaki go in a direction other than friendship…  \n  \nThis is a fluffy sweet werebeast love story between a quiet Kishu weredog who likes to take care of others and an honestly sweet werecat who start out as friends.  \n  \n**Note: To avoid DMCA since this title is still ongoing, we will only release the first chapter for public**"
