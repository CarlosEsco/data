   "en": "Naoko is a professional woman working for a major travel agency in Tokyo. Supported by her understanding husband, she thought she had the perfect life both at work and at home, until one day her husband suddenly disappears, leaving behind a large amount of debt, his company bankrupt. Naoko decides to wait for her husband's return while working off their debts by walking through the door of Kaguraya, a long-established ryokan in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture. The proprietress of the inn is Naoko's mother-in-law, who had disowned the couple, refusing to recognize their marriage. Naoko manages to stay on at Kaguraya despite being cursed, \"I won't recognize an 'enjimon' (outsider) as my daughter-in-law.\" Naoko is determined to become the proprietress, and she is determined to start her life anew!"
