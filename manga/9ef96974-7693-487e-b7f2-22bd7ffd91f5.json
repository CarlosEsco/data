    "en": "It's the first day of the new school year and Juhyun... Well, he's not exactly enthused. In fact, the only things on his mind are girls. The girls at his school, to be specific. Jigoo, on the other hand, wakes up early and gets ready and stops by Juhyun's home on the way to school. And, as it turns out, Jigoo might not be as interested in girls as Juhyun is. Juhyun is about to find out that some secrets are hard to keep quiet. And sometimes, everyone needs a little help."
