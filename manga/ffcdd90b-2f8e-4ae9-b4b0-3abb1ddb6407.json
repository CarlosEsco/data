    "en": "On the first day of summer vacation, Haruto Ogi, a university student, fell in love with Shinya Tago, a handsome high school student who is blind.\r\nAlthough they quickly got along and became friends, Ogi was just being swayed by Tago who didn't realize he was in love.\r\nI was asked to touch my fingers and I was pushed down saying \u0026quot;Tell me what's going on down here.\u0026quot; --- I'm absolutely red, but it's safe because he can't see, right!?\r\nOgi chooses to remain just a friend, but when Tago learns of Ogi's feelings, he takes a surprising course of action!"
