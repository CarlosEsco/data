    "en": "The time is Genroku and the place is Ooku. There was only one man who was allowed to be selfish and unreliable in this women's garden where men were forbidden except for the shogun. He was the head of the Edo shogunate's tokoyokata, the Imperial Household. People called him \u0026quot;Oshitone Tenshitsu\u0026quot; because he was in charge of selecting the shogun's partners for the night. He is an unparalleled judge of the floor, dealing with beautiful women of all shapes and sizes!ã€€A historian's astonishing story of Tenshitsu's brilliant days in the Genroku era!"
