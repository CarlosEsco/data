    "en": "Ichijou is a high school boy that is in love with the girl named Himekawa. So he placed a love letter in her shoe locker, but it turns out he placed his love letter in the wrong locker. In Miyuki's, that is a gyaru.\r\n\r\nOne day, Miyuki calls Ichijou to the roof of the school to confront him about the love letter. In the end, Miyuki ended up telling Ichijou the truth about Himekawa, and how she isn't that pure, good girl he thought she was, and that hurt Ichijou and made him depressed. However, Miyuki was not done with Ichijou, because she wanted to give him something in return, as an apology for making him depressed."
