   "en": "This is a story of Ikuma and Sumika, two childhood friends who recently got married and started a brand new life together. At first sight, they seem like a happy couple with nothing to worry about, there is one problem: they have trouble having sex. With both of them having zero prior experience, this awkward couple tries their best(?) to figure out together how to do it for the first time.  \n—————-  \nIkuma Saeki finally married his childhood friend and the girl of his dreams, Sumika. But while years of pining came easily to him, physical closeness does not…and he's having trouble navigating the intimacy that comes with marriage. Sumika, too, is having trouble bridging the gap between friend and lover…what is this innocent couple to do but navigate it together, awkwardness and all! A new rom-com from the author of Ao-chan Can't Study!"
