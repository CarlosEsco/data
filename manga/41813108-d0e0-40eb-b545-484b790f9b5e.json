    "en": "Sui is an actress who has just debuted, but she only took on roles as either vengeful spirits or evil supporting lead. Although her goal is to be the top actress in the industry, Sui has a fatal weakness --- that is her fear of men (androphobia)!!\r\n\r\nSui was offered a chance as a leading role in a new romance drama. It's a great chance for Sui but it's fully loaded with lovey-dovey scenes. All the touching, kissing, bed scenes were driving Sui crazy! In order to succeed, Rihito (Sui's new manager) spent 3 days 3 nights to research on treatment of androphobia. Sui, touched by Rihito's perserverance, determined to work hard for his sake. However, would she be able to interact with men naturally?? And her feelings for Rihito...\r\n\r\nIncluded side stories: 保健室のヒミツ (保健室的秘密), 恋なんかじゃない!? (这不是恋爱吧!?)"
