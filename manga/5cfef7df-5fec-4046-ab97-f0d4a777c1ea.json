   "en": "High school student, Sunao, was commuting to school when he noticed a salaryman on the bus. On his ring finger, were teeth marks hidden by a ring. Who left those marks? Is it a sign of possession? Or maybe…  \n  \nBefore he knew it, Sunao's head was filled with fantasies about him. One day, he runs into the salaryman at his part time job at an izakaya. He drunkenly confronts Sunao and kisses him…!?  \n  \nThese straightforward and painful emotions are too young to be called love. A love between a high school student and a salaryman!  \n  \nAlso included is an extra, \"6th Year Obsession,\" featuring the two of them after the events of the main story!"
