    "en": "Kosumo has a serious medical condition that landed her in a hospital ever since she was a child. Since Kosumo's blood type is the rare AB negative, it is next to impossible to find a donor. While she was on the verge of death, out in the city, the 99th Generation Miko, Himiko-sama got into a terrible accident while trying to save the life of a child. She was rushed to the hospital and that\u0026rsquo;s when Himiko and Kosumo's fates crossed. Since it was obvious that Himiko was surely going to die as a result of the accident, the hospital decided to use her as a donor for Kosumo\u0026rsquo;s condition after they discovered that she also has the rare AB negative blood type. Kosumo got better and moved back to Tokyo, and later found out that Himiko\u0026rsquo;s heart and blood aren\u0026rsquo;t the only thing flowing inside her\u0026hellip;"
