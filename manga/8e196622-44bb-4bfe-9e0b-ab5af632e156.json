   "en": "After a fall-out with his ex-girlfriend’s family, Hikaru’s older brother, Kaname, brings home a new girlfriend named Narita Tsugumi or “Tsugumi-chan”. Everyone in his family, including Hikaru, is shocked when they open the door to find a woman who looks exactly like Kaname’s ex-girlfriend, but she is ushered into his room before the secret can be revealed. Hikaru accidentally finds out that she is working at Bar Clap, and that personality-wise, she is the exact opposite of Kaname’s ex-girlfriend. Even though Tsugumi-chan swears him to secrecy, Hikaru is touched by her loneliness and unconditional love for his brother, and begins struggling with the weight of the truth and his newfound feelings.  \n  \nAlso contains two other oneshots:  \n* Four Seasons  \n* The Other Side of the Monochrome\n"
