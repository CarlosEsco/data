    "en": "Rinsen Academy\u0026rsquo;s Miyako and Touyou High\u0026rsquo;s Nora are promising swimmers. In elementary school, Miyako called out to Nora, who couldn\u0026rsquo;t get used to his surroundings, and since then they\u0026rsquo;ve been friends. But Nora started having feelings for Miyako that overcome those of real love. Miyako had accepted that for a while, but gradually began refusing it and grew away from the swimming world. \r\nThen one day the two meet again."
