    "en": "1-2: Marude Hajimete no Koi Mitai ni (Like A First Love) \r\nSalesman Kouno is running out of time! He has three days to sell one million yen worth of safes or he's fired, but Kouno is a horrible salesman, and only goes to houses with inviting architecture. Meeting the weird architect Itou is his only chance to make quota, but Itou has other things on his mind...\r\n\r\n3-4: Joiki wo Keshite, Amaoto de (Silencing A Sigh With The Sound Of Rainfall)\r\nOn his way to work, Takano meets a stranger who returns an umbrella to him that he'd apparently lent out a long time ago. But when he meets said person again for a job interview, he behaves extremely cold towards Takano \u0026ndash; who still tries to befriend him.\r\n\r\n5: Subete wo Anata ni (Everything, For You)\r\nAt first working for the strict Kaneko was difficult for Kiyose, but he's gotten used to his boss' gruff ways and has even fallen in love with him. The praise (and head pats) Kiyose receives for his hard work have him pushing himself to the limit, but suddenly Kaneko becomes distant. Did Kaneko discover his feelings, or is there another reason for the sudden gulf between them?"
