Just who is this mysterious stranger?\r\n\r\n4) Let's go wild, Baby\r\nDangan Baby extra\r\n\r\n5) The Kitten and the Prince / The Cat and the King\r\nOosado works as a researcher on pheromones and keeps Goro, a giant pet cat, at his laboratory.

Just what is wrong with this piano and its owner...?\r\n\r\n9) After\r\nYour Favorite Song extra\r\n\r\nNote:  The scanlator combined chapters 2 \u0026 3 into one chapter, and did the same with chapters 4 \u0026 5.
