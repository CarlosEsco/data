    "en": "\u0026quot;In this world, there are all kinds of perils! I'll teach you how to save yourself from those dangers, you moron!\u0026quot; So says Dangerous Jiisan, always looking out for his grandson. But, lacking any common sense, he usually makes things catastrophically worse in ridiculous, funny ways.\r\n\r\nIt's a children's gag comedy largely done in manzai style (funny man vs. straight man). Most of the jokes are silly, with ridiculous occurrences, puns, poking fun at popular culture, and breaking the fourth wall, but there is some subtle humor in places, too. Zettaizetsumei Denjarasu Jiisan received the 2005 Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga."
