    "en": "This manga tells the  legacy of Mitsuyo Maeda a Brazilian naturalized as Ot\u0026aacute;vio Maeda, who was a Japanese jud≈çka (judo expert) and prizefighter in no holds barred competitions. He was also known as Count Combat or Conde Koma in Spanish and Portuguese, a nickname he picked up in Spain in 1908. Along with Ant\u0026ocirc;nio Soshihiro Satake (another naturalized Brazilian), he pioneered judo in Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries.\r\n\r\nMaeda was fundamental to the development of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, including through his teaching of Carlos Gracie and others of the Gracie family. He was also a promoter of Japanese emigration to Brazil. Maeda won more than 2,000 professional fights in his career. His accomplishments led to him being called the \u0026quot;toughest man who ever lived\u0026quot; and being referred to as the father of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu."
