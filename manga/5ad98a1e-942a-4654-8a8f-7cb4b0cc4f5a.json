    "en": "[From Mystic Iris]\r\nKingyo is my step-sister. She was the person I loved the most in this world, but I\u0026rsquo;ve hurt her. Things can never go back to normal ever again. I hate myself for being such a coward, but there\u0026rsquo;s nothing that can be done about it.\r\n\r\n[From Sound of Jewels and Sumire no Team]\r\nKingyo is the most lovely name in the world.\r\nShe was my stepsister. She had the most beautiful smile.\r\nShe was a crybaby. She was so kind that I couldn't bear it and\r\n...I crossed the line."
