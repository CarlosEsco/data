His family is opposed to him being involved with anything but traditional music. Amamiya Keigo finds Kaduki singing in front of his apartment building. Kaduki collapses and Amamiya takes him to his apartment and cares for Kaduki, as though Kaduki were a stray cat. Kaduki begs to be allowed to stay and work for Amamiya. Amamiya agrees.
