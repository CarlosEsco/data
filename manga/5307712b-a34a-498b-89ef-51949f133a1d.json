    "en": "Among friends, there aren\u0026rsquo;t many who move on to become lovers. A first experience of love = First Kiss x Fireworks Festival.\r\n\r\nFor as long as we have known each other, you have always been my close friend who\u0026rsquo;s always by my side no matter which shenanigans I got myself into. But this summer, I would want to change our status and become your lover\u0026hellip; What should I do to move us forward and deepen our bonds? \r\n\r\nThis summer during the second year of high school is overflowing with youthfulness. Everyone is spending their days in high spirits and it would be perfect if this romantic love could be fulfilled. Toraji, he\u0026rsquo;s just like himself usually, constantly surrounded by his friends. He\u0026rsquo;s easily approachable, easy to get along with, and quite good looking. Even so, he\u0026rsquo;s often teased by his friends for remaining single and choosing to be nonchalant about it. To move forward from being his friend to becoming his lover, why is this path unusually distant?"
