   "en": "The year is 2071. Both polar ice caps have melted submerging most of the Earth causing humanity to flee into the oceans. However, humanity splits into two groups, those retain their original human appearance, and the Dugong, those who rebirthed themselves as creatures suitable for underwater life via genetic manipulation. Now, the Dugong are on the warpath destroying one underwater city after another. Can humanity stop this overwhelming threat?"
