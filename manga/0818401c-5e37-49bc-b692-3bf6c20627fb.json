    "en": "Ririka Otsuka is the hottest girl at school and is at the center of every guy's attention. \r\n\"There's no guy out there that doesn't fall for me!\" \r\nHer only secret was that her house was a shabby old table tennis center…\r\nOne day, a transfer student appears before Ririka—Ageha Hanazono.\r\nDespite his fairy-tale name, he's a super lame and nerdy guy with glasses. Ririka lightheartedly goes and tries to tease Ageha. \r\nHowever, Ageha responds with— \r\n\"I'm already in a committed relationship with table tennis. Therefore I do not intend to engage in an illicit sexual relationship with you.\"\r\nHow...humiliating! There's actually a guy that doesn't fall for me—Ririka Otsuka?! Ririka sets up a table tennis match to try and outwit Ageha. \r\nOnce the lame and nerdy pervert (a.k.a. the main character) is given a racket, he flies like a butterfly and dances atop the tables!!\r\n\r\nAn all new hyper fast table tennis manga—Love all!!\r\n\r\n[b]Included one-shot:[/b] Takujou no Ageha [i](In volume 3, pilot)[/i]\r\nWhat happens when the cutest girl in school confesses her love to a table tennis fanatic? Gets rejected of course! There's only 1 love in his heart and that's for table tennis. The other sports clubs in school can't stand him getting all the attention and seek to beat him at his own game.\r\n\r\n[sub]As a part of the JUMP START initiative, the first three chapters of Takujo no Ageha: The Table Tennis of Ageha were published in English in VIZ Media's digital Weekly Shonen Jump.[/sub]"
