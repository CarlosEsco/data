    "en": "Iroha works at a small family bakery downtown, and she has her eyes on the cute, younger part-time staff member, Ippei. He looks a little... actually, very scary, but once you get to know him, he's a total sweetheart. Iroha's always smiling and being nice to people, but deep down, she's hiding her true feelings. Ippei's kindness envelopes her and gradually warms her up... A cute, sweet, and warm love story with a younger guy!"
