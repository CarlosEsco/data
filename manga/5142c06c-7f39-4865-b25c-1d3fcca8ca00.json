    "en": "Takemura is a distant, workaholic designer in the planning division. While most of his officemates had given up on interacting with him, his loud co-worker Masaki Natsui is persistent on breaking his indifferent demeanor. When one trip to the convenient store leads to Takemura crossing paths with Masaki and his adopted son, Mori, everything changes for Takemura as he is pulled into a somewhat makeshift family dynamic with the two."
