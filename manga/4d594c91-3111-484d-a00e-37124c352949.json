He hadn't expected to work there permanently, but circumstances had left him to stay. Life wasn't that great, but a meeting with Jiro from the tofu shop changed that. And after that it seemed as though chance and kindness slowly weaved them into each other's life.\r\n\r\n6) Seishun Nano Missile Heaven (The Attack of the Youth Missile)\r\nA oneshot concerning friends since elementary school, and it's time for a birthday celebration.
