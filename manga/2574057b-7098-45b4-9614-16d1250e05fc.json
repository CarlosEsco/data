   "en": "An assassin who cannot kill x a blind young man\n\n\"If you knew the real me... you'd be disappointed.\"\nBorn into a family of assassins and living in a world of darkness, Chinatsu has been unable to kill anyone due to his past trauma.\nWhen Chinatsu's brother died before his very eyes, a boy reached out a hand to him.\nThat scene is still burned into his mind...\n\nWhile having the same nightmare yet again, Chinatsu happens to see the boy from that day, Kasumi, again.\nUnable to leave the blind boy alone, Chinatsu unexpectedly becomes his \"friend\", but... Chinatsu, who suffers his family's curse, and Kasumi, who despite his blindness is spirited and pure.\nThis is a story of salvation that melts the loneliness of two people living in darkness."
