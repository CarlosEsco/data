    "en": "From Renta!:\r\n\r\nIt's been six years since Takeshi (alpha) and Yoshihisa (omega) have been dating. Even though they have a sweet life together, it doesn't look like the serious Takeshi wants to become a pair with Yoshihisa. \u0026quot;Maybe he doesn't bite me because we're not a 'destiny pair.'\u0026quot; Yoshihisa is so worried about Takeshi's \u0026quot;destiny pair\u0026quot; that he forgets to take his heat suppressant pills and becomes consumed with a very strong heat. The heat is so uncontrollable, the two forget to use contraception and make meltingly passionate love... An omegaverse love story controlled by destiny! Also included is a story about an office worker and a genius D.J."
