It's the first time she's seen him in 10 years and he's just as attractive as he was when they went to school together. They weren't really close, she just marveled at him from outside his shop, while she waited impatiently for him to talk to her.\n\n\"If you don't have anything interesting to talk about...\", Riko said when Baba suddenly kissed her.\n\"Huh...what was that?...What😕\"\n\"A kiss. You are cute, so I kissed you.\"\nWhaat?! Was Baba-kun always this kind of person?!\n\nIn that moment her image of him completely changed, did he become a predator in those 10 years? How does a composed medical intern magically become like that because of a woman he likes?! 【Popular Boy】×【Quiet Girl】 Reunited and heart pounding ♪ A story about mutually unrequited love!"
