    "en": "Oto Tachibana, a 17-year-old, good-natured and caring girl, decides to earn her own school fees from now on, so she takes a job at her new school as a dormitory maid for \"Class Z,\" an elitist class full of people with special talents. As such, she starts her new life away from her family in the dormitory, surrounded by (mainly) boys that are all a little different. Among them is Jin, the dormitory head, a boy who is amazingly strong and who keeps a \"cuddly\" pet at the dormitory's swimming pool - a pet shark! The quite charming and funny story revolves around the daily lives of the people in the dormitory, and in the middle is the relationship that Oto and Jin are starting to build."
