    "en": "Fuwa Kosuke is a very timid and unassuming junior high school student. His parents died when he was young so he lives with his father's friend Kobayakawa, a professor of archaeology, along with his daughter Saeko Kobayakawa, who is also Kosuke's homeroom teacher. One day Kosuke is critically injured when he is hit by a car and killed by a thief who breaks into the house. When everyone is convinced that he is dead, Kosuke's brainwaves begin to show signs of abnormality and his body shows an amazing and instantaneous recovery. While Kosuke's change was instantaneous, and all but his miraculous recovery seemed to be due to his imagination, the professor was the only one who couldn't help but worry about Kosuke. He had seen the 'silver-haired Kosuke' nine years ago. The silver-haired Kosuke has a super brain and senses that make it hard to believe that he is a child. He has discovered that his father was killed in a fake accident and that his assistant, Kuchisaki, was responsible for the accident, and he sentenced him to death by fire.\r\n\r\nKosuke and Saeko go to the ruins of a school event, and the professor, who has been accompanying them to the event, runs into a thief who has stolen the materials from their house, and is trapped in a trap that he has inadvertently set. He becomes the silver-haired Kosuke again and begins to solve the mystery of the ruins. From then on, the Kobayakawa family is caught up in a battle between many organizations that are trying to obtain the secrets of the ancient ruins. Silver-haired Kosuke' becomes known as 'Silver Wolf' in the midst of this battle, and this leads to a battle with the Lorenz Foundation, the child prodigy organization that killed Kosuke's father.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Kosuke's own body is also affected by the imbalance between \u0026quot;Silver Wolf\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Ordinary Kosuke\u0026quot;. Kosuke's own body cannot keep up with the silver-haired Kosuke's abilities, and this ultimately results in the overworking of his body and brain, reducing his life span. The Lorenz Foundation then launches its final operation. They plan to revive the super-ancient final weapon and exterminate the human race. Kosuke rides to the Foundation's home base to save his friends and defeat the Lord of the Foundation, albeit at a cost. When all is said and done, the silver-haired Kosuke falls into an eternal sleep with no end in sight. But once again, when his loved ones are in danger, Kosuke's silver hair will shine again."
