   "en": "Yuu Mashiro, an ex-delinquent with bad eyesight who was feared as the \"White Tiger of the West,\" pursued her dream of working in design, and as a result, landed a job at a small printing company in the suburbs of Tokyo. Of course, in front of everyone, she hides her delinquent past. She is thrilled to have a job that allows her to work on the manga he loves, but in the printing industry her seniors and colleagues are very particular and specific about the details which sometimes leads to her old delinquent personality to leak out! However, during all the work and stress there are also some moments between her and her colleagues that keeps her going...! This is a workplace comedy that describes Yuu Mashiro who is single-minded in everything she does, struggles through the rough and tumble of the printing company, as well as provide readers with a glimpse of the printing industry!"
