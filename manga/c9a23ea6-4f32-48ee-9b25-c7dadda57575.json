   "en": "1-3: Hana to Usagi (Flower And Bunny)  \nAizawa Mamoru-san in room 411 is always wearing a rabbit-head… The courier company's good customer is a shy rabbit-man with a withdrawal syndrome. Why is he wearing something like that in the first place? Is he a pervert? Everyday, he receives deliveries, but you can't see his face and he's mute: there's nothing scarier than this.  \n  \nBut one day, still wearing the rabbit-head, he grabbed tightly onto my arm, \"T-thank you, I'll see you again tomorrow…\" Saying it in such an embarrassed way – my heart beats so fast.  \n  \n4: That Smile Once Again  \nFujimura is a talented pianist who refuses to perform in the school's culture festival, despite the student council president's – Segawa – attempts to convince him daily. Why won't Fujimura perform? And why does Segawa keep on pestering him?   \n  \n5: Greatest Common Denominator  \nTatchan and Shouhei are in a relationship. Shouhei wants to ramp it up to the next level, but Tatchan seems hesitant. Is this love just one-sided?"
