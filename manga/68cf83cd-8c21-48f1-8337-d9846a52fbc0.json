    "en": "Happily married couple Takamine and Yukiko are currently in the process of moving to the rural countryside village Osutane upon an invitation from Takamine's older sister. There, the air is clean and the sun is bright\u0026mdash;the perfect environment to raise their young son, Shuuichi.\r\n\r\nHowever, this village is no ordinary place of residence. For years, familial connections have been practically nonexistent as the villagers strongly believe that women are the \u0026quot;greatest treasure,\u0026quot; and therefore their bodies should be shared equally among the people... and the young and alluring Yukiko is no exception from this sacred tradition."
