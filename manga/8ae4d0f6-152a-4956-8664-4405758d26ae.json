   "en": "Yokoi Taku has trouble getting along with people, so he moved to Tokyo as soon as he graduated from high school. He now lives alone, making a living by delivering newspapers and drawing doujinshi, though people totally ignore his non-erotic works. One day, a girl named Saitou Megumi suddenly shows up at his door, claiming that she came all the way from Tottori to meet him because she's a big fan of one of his original works. It ends up that she has faced many hardships herself, and with no intention of leaving, she ends up living with him.  \n\n\n---\n\n  \nThe author of the manga is requesting people send a message to the editor on Twitter to gauge interest in an official English release.
