    "en": "[Google Translate]\r\n\r\nThere are many cases of inheritances. In Japan, a country which has become an aging society is truly a big \u0026quot;conflict\u0026quot; era!\r\n\r\nToday a fierce \u0026quot;conflict\u0026quot; over heritage has begun at the funeral of the great writer. One man who came with such a stinky smell, his name is Nanao Ashie.\r\nHaie, who is a detective specializing in troubles related to inheritance, reveals the secret of the \u0026quot;video will\u0026quot; left by the writer with a hyena-like sense of smell."
