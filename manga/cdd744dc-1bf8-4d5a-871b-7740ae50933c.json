    "en": "A collection of six different books published between 1999 and 2010 by Shirow Miwa, author of Dogs, based on Final Fantasy 7, 8, and 9. (No crossover content. All drama, all awesome.)\r\n\r\n1. Final Fantasy VII \u0026ndash; Agharta\r\nThe final battle as at hand. As Meteor crashes down upon the planet, Cloud is forced to confront his false memories and the question of his own existence in a brutal mental attack even while Avalanche struggles to stay alive in a losing battle against Safer Sephiroth. (Features all of Avalanche vs Sephiroth, plus the Turks.)\r\n\r\n2. Final Fantasy VIII \u0026ndash; Fragile I\r\nOn the way back from a mission, Squall sneaks off alone to settle the score with a face from the past.\r\n\r\n3. Final Fantasy VIII \u0026ndash; Fragile II\r\nKiller fight scenes, depressive anti-anti-heroes, and a heroine that somehow makes spectating into an art form in the conclusion to Fragile.\r\n\r\n4. Final Fantasy VII \u0026ndash; Asche zu Asche \r\nSet prior to the events of Final Fantasy VII. Sephiroth and Tseng have a lengthy heart-to-heart about the war in Wutai, not-so-covert operations, and Hojo\u0026rsquo;s psychopathic tendencies. (Features Sephiroth, Tseng, and Hojo.)\r\n\r\n5. Final Fantasy IX \u0026ndash; A Story\r\nAfter the Iifa tree unceremoniously dumps Kuja into a heap after the events of the game, he wanders his way to the Black Mage village where granting the request of an old enemy nearing the end of his days might just save the black remains of his soul from spending an eternity in hell. After all, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to leave something of themselves behind when they\u0026rsquo;re gone?\r\n\r\n6. The F \u0026ndash; Epilogue"
