The Chateau du Amour specializes in providing the company of beautiful, cultured men to female customers. Few people know that the popular Kiriya is actually Yamada Kotarou, a boy from Nagasaki who came to Tokyo to find a way to repay his parent's debt. \r\nSome of the other hosts, jealous of his position, are determined to get past his perfect facade to discredit him. Kiriya will have a hard time stopping them, especially after a former customer dumps an adorable 5-year-old girl on him, claiming he is the father. The only thing that could make this situation more difficult would be the arrival of his Nagasaki girlfriend Miharu, who knows nothing of his career as a host...\r\n\r\n4. Apple!\r\nA kind-hearted guy who grows up eating cakes and whose parents own an tartlet cafe, wants to be the ultimate gang leader. A villainous girl who was brought up in a family of gangsters wants to be the owner of a tartlet shop! How will the pair cross one another's path with their dreams of the opposite party?"
