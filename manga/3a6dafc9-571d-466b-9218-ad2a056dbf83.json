    "en": "Riko (whose real name is Ayako) was already in high school when she gained a new younger brother. Miguel is a nine-year-old Peruvian boy rescued by her father in the midst of turmoil before he came home to his loving family in Japan. Miguel had a good grasp of Japanese but he didn't seem to be warming up at first. He was overly polite and he barely smiled. But Riko was determined to make sure that he felt that he was now a part of her family, introducing him to the world outside and to the game of basketball\u0026hellip; Now Miguel is in high school, fresh out of the international school. And he has proven he can be good at many things: in academics, in sports\u0026hellip; but even though he seems to be really good at basketball (showed the students their first live look at a dunk), and though he seems to really like it, he seems unwilling. What is he afraid of? What is he pushing away?"
