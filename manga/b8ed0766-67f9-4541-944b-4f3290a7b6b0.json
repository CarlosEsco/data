   "en": "The creepy stalker Tokiwagi Taimatsu has always been obsessed with athletic girls. He finds them very attractive while they're practicing their sports, but he also feels an intense need to support and guide them. However, he has no athletic talent of his own. Now he is attending an all-boys' high school, and his focus has turned to the neighboring all-girls' school.   \n  \nHis latest target is Soubi Kureha, the lovely captain of her high school's ice hockey club. She is very dedicated to her sport, and aims to take on the world. Tokiwagi has studied and stalked enough that he feels certain he could help her toward her goal, if he were allowed to supervise the team. At first, the girls reject him completely. When he proves that he might actually be able to help, though, it looks like his dream of fighting alongside Kureha's hockey team might come true!"
