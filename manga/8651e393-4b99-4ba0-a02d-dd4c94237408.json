    "en": "Harumi's your typical grade 9 girl. Sure, she still sleeps with her stuffed animal that she dubbed \u0026quot;Umetaro,\u0026quot; and her ability to sense snow before it falls is labelled as just plain \u0026quot;weird\u0026quot; by her friends, but otherwise, she's your average girl just like any other.\r\n\r\nWhen her mother accidentally ruins her stuffed animal though by accidentally spilling coffee all over it, it sets the ball rolling for a series of events that changes her outlook on life.\r\n\r\nShe even meets a young guy working at a local knick knacks shop who reminds her of her beloved Umetaro! As she gets to know him more, she begins to realize that there is someone out there in the world who'll accept her for who she is.\r\n\r\nAlso contains an extra story:\r\nãƒ»10 Nen mo 20 Nen mo (10, 20 Years from Now)\r\n\r\nKonashi is a hard-working swimming buff who's focused on becoming good enough to land himself a spot in the upcoming summer swim competition. One day while heading to the pool to swim as always, he spots a guy he's never seen before standing on the jumping board with his clothes and shoes still on.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out---he's Eguchi, the resident class \u0026quot;mystery\u0026quot; who's only ever attended one of his classes. As they get talking, Konashi realizes he's nothing like the rumours made him out to be---and so began a quirky brief friendship that leaves a strong impression on him even years later."
