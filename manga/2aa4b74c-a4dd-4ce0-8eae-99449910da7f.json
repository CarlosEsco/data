    "en": "1-2: Closing Day\r\nTwo guys become fast friends due to their mutual love for gaming, until one of them begins to want something else entirely...\r\n\r\n3: The Voices Of Cicadas\r\nDue to his deep-rooted fear of abandonment, Iwasaki has always preferred 'easy' relationships with married men looking for a quick lay, so as to ensure that the 'inevitable' breakup will be \u0026quot;fast, clean, and peaceful,\u0026quot; since there's no chance that he'll come to expect genuine love from the other party. Needless to say, this seemingly foolproof plan has one major flaw...\r\n\r\n4: Chocolate Soldier\r\nWhy do people try so hard to obtain things, when simply watching should be enough?\r\n\r\n5: Laundream\r\nClumsy but hard-working, the overworked Amamiya has been losing sleep for days, and finally manages to catch a nap while waiting at the laundromat.\r\n\r\n6: To Hate Without Trying\r\nKubota, who's never been married, has an odd propensity for turning down prospective wives on the grounds that they love eating taiyaki, which he claims to hate. But what's the true story behind his strange aversion to such a popular and delicious food?\r\n\r\n7: Spring Storm\r\nChecking back in with the pair from Closing Day.\r\n\r\n8: Together, Hand In Hand\r\nRevisiting the boys from Chocolate Soldier, as high school graduation grows near."
