   "en": "One chapter in the saga of Shima Kousaku, salaryman at Hatsushiba Electric.  \n  \nIn this part of the series, Kousaku has just started working at a branch office for the company doing an unexpected amount of menial labor when a chance meeting with the company president leads to his dearest wish being granted as he is transferred to the central office. Not all is well there, though, as he becomes involved in the complicated affairs of his colleagues, whether in business or in romance. In spite of everything, however, he retains his faith in the company and an unflappable optimism."
