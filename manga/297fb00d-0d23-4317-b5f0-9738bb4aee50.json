    "en": "[*] Ketchup Mayonnaise\r\nAtsushi's bar-tending mom remarries to a rich, strait-laced (if not slightly old) salaryman. They move into their new house, and he can now sleep in a bed fit for a Prince! With the union, they've become one big happy family with him, his mom, his new step-dad, his step-dad's kids Peter and Kurara, and the ghost of his ex-wife....wait, what?!\r\n\r\n[*] The Spring of Water\r\nMaki should be on cloud nine---she's snagged the boyfriend of her dreams after finally confessing her love for him on the train platform, with a little help from her friend Fumika. They've even passed the half year mark in dating when everyone around them predicted they wouldn't last a month. Why is it then that she's starting to get the feeling that this was all a mistake?\r\n\r\n[*] Chocolate Ice Cream\r\nSakura's been in love with Niiya ever since she wound up in the same class as him back in elementary school. Niiya, however, doesn't seem to be as enthusiastic about her. So of course, when God gives her the chance to change her face to one he'd madly fall for, she readily agrees! Who does she become? And does she finally get her man after 14 years of unrequited love?"
