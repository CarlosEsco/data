    "en": "Seina Yamada may just be the unluckiest guy in the world. As Tenchi Masaki's classmate, this walking time bomb seems to spread destruction and bad fortune wherever he goes. But when a suprise encounter with a beautiful woman leaves him with lipstick on his face and a Galaxy Police pamphlet, it seems his luck is about to turn around. Now, he has become a member of the GP Academy and is about to face the challenges of squaring off against space pirates, adapting to a new advanced society, and sneaking out after curfew with his friends."
