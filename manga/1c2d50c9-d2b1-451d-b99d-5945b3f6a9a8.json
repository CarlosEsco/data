    "en": "After a very public (and humiliating) break-up with her last boyfriend, things couldn't get any worse for 18 year old Emiko. Things start looking up however, when a good-looking guy stops her in the middle of the street to offer her tickets to an upcoming rock concert.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, he's just one of three brothers from the Kanita family: Gaku - 18, Youji - 19, and Masaki - 23. A chance encounter with his older brother, Youji, leads to a whirlwind romance. He's impulsive, hot-headed, and even a bit self-centered, but she finds his frankness, though brutal at times, refreshing and she ends up falling for him....HARD.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected turn comes her way however when it's revealed that Youji and Yuri, a close friend of hers from back in middle school, knew each other before she met Youji. They don't seem to get along at all----what happened between them?\r\n\r\nAlso contains one-shot:\r\n\u0026quot;I'm Going to Become That Star\u0026quot;\r\nSanshiro, a happy-go-lucky 17 year old, gets a serious head injury that lands him in a coma after he jumps into the road to save a girl from an oncoming car! During his comatose state, he's told by a mysterious being (aka his pet turtle that died ages ago) that the girl he saved is actually the reincarnated form of the lover he had to part with in his previous life! Well, that's great and all, but the reincarnated form of his lover turns out to be...a 9 year old girl?!"
