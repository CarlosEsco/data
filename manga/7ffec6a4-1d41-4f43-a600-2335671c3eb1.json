    "en": "Michio Yuki has it all: looks, intelligence, a pedigree as the scion of a famous Kabuki family, a promising career at a major bank, legions of female admirers. But underneath the sheen of perfection lurks a secret with the power to shake the world to its foundations.\r\n\r\nDuring a boyhood excursion to one of the southern archipelagos near Okinawa, Yuki barely survived exposure to a poison gas stored at a foreign military facility. The leakage annihilated all of the island\u0026rsquo;s inhabitants but was promptly covered up by the authorities, leaving Yuki as an unacknowledged witness\u0026mdash;one whose sense of right and wrong, however, the potent nerve agent managed to obliterate.\r\n\r\nNow, fifteen years later, Yuki is a social climber of Balzacian proportions, infiltrating the worlds of finance and politics by day while brutally murdering children and women by night\u0026mdash;perversely using his Kabuki-honed skills as a female impersonator to pass himself off as the women he\u0026rsquo;s killed. His drive, however, will not be satiated with a promotion here and a rape there. Michio Yuki has a far more ominous objective: obtaining MW, the ultimate weapon that spared his life but robbed him of all conscience.\r\n\r\nThere are only two men with any hope of stopping him: one, a brilliant public prosecutor who struggles to build a case against the psychopath; the other, a tormented Catholic priest, Iwao Garai, who shares Yuki\u0026rsquo;ls past\u0026mdash;and frequently his bed."
