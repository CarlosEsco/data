     "en": "Eiichiro Oda, born January 1, 1975 in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan, is a professional manga artist, best known as the creator of the manga One Piece.\n\nA dedicated writer and artist since adolescence, Oda began working for Shueisha's Shonen Jump at 17. He once worked as an assistant to manga artist such as [Kaitani Shinobu](https://mangadex.org/author/07716641-e21e-431b-8456-d74f48986c35/kaitani-shinobu), [Tokuhiro Masaya](https://mangadex.org/author/628ddce4-66c6-4b90-95a3-1d8ffd7b7309/tokuhiro-masaya), and [Watsuki Nobuhiro](https://mangadex.org/author/e718ceea-6dff-4297-bd36-1cecaf077e83/watsuki-nobuhiro). He currently stands as one of the world's most prominent manga artist earning an estimated ¥3.1 billion (US$26 million) per year.
