   "en": "Kato-kun (Mr. Kato) is an ordinary boy who works at a convenience store. Extraordinary things have started happening to him since he picked up a beautiful girl at a bar one night. It turns out she is an Angel–literally! She has two wings that sprout from her back, and only a few people can see her. She's moved into his bachelor pad, and he feels like he's in heaven. Although he has no idea where she is from or why she is living with him, he lets her stay as long as she wants. An Angel is a savior–and there are a lot of people who need saving! She crosses the paths of a neglected kindergartner, a troubled middle-school student, and she even helps Kato himself in his attempts to befriend a pretty girl named Miho."
