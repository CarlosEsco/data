    "en": "It's a manga adaptation of \u0026quot;Das Kapital\u0026quot; by Karl Marx. It's published under まんがで読破 by East Press, which is a series of paperback manga who are adaptations of masterpieces of literature.\r\nIt provides an introduction to the German socialist's original work, written in 1867. The targeted readers are office workers in their 30s.\r\n\r\nThe fictionalized Vol. 1 of \u0026quot;Das Kapital\u0026quot; chronicles a cheese factory run by protagonist Robin, who rebels against his father's socialist principles and becomes a slave driver after teaming up with a cold-blooded capitalist investor. But Robin struggles between his capitalist ambitions and his sense of guilt over the exploitation of his workers.\r\n\r\nThe book is being translated into English, Korean and Chinese for its upcoming manga debut in the U.S., Asia and Europe."
