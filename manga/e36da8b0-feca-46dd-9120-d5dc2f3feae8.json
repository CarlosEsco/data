   "en": "Doraemon, a cat shaped robot which came from the 22nd century in the future, goes back in time in order to help Nobita, a below average lazy kid, to make his life less miserable and improve his descendent's life. With many of Doreamon's gadgets from the future, Nobita's life will never be as the same.  \n  \nThis title is a classic manga/anime that dates back to 1969 and is still a child's favorite even today.  \n  \nNote: It was awarded the first Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982 and also won the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Grand Prize in 1997. In March 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon as the nation's first \"anime ambassador\"."

Throughout their career they won many individual and collaborative awards, and are best known for creating the popular and long-running series Doraemon, the main character of which is officially recognized as a cultural icon of modern Japan. Some influences of most of their projects are the works of acclaimed manga artist [Osamu Tezuka](https://mangadex.org/author/21575d70-b954-4e3a-80df-00192f413a83) and many US cartoons and comic books—including the works of Hanna-Barbera."
