   "en": "Ping pong. Table tennis. Fast, furious. You might have seen it - even played it - but never anything like this! The action is centered around Tsukimoto ('Smile') and Hoshino ('Peko'); childhood friends who have been playing the sport ever since they were elementary students.   \n  \nTsukimoto - the impassive, bespectacled, seemingly-emotionless boy described as a robot by everyone who knows him, plays \"to kill time\". Hoshino, the passionate, out-going, charismatic 'hero' who Tsukimoto idolized during their childhood, plays because he \"loves ping pong and hates to lose\".   \n  \nHow will the cold, cruel world of competitive sports treat these two who are so different? And what will happen upon their inevitable meeting as contenders for the High School Men's Singles Trophy?   \n  \nAdapted to a feature-length film by SORI in 2002."
