    "en": "Sihoon is handsome, cultured and rich. What else would you expect from an established doctor? He's everything that Junyoung wants to be, once he gets out of college.\r\n\r\nOh, and Junyoung's not gay. At least, that's what he says... while he's more or less having sex with Sihoon. A man.
