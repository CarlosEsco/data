     "en": "Osamu Tezuka (手塚 治虫, b. 手塚 治, Tezuka Osamu; 3 November 1928 – 9 February 1989) was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist, and animator. Born in Osaka Prefecture, his prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as \"the Father of Manga\" (マンガの父, Manga no Chichi), \"the Godfather of Manga\" (マンガの教父, Manga no Kyōfu) and \"the God of Manga\" (マンガの神様, Manga no Kami-sama). \n\nTezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his [New Treasure Island](https://mangadex.org/title/d528a5fd-e033-4283-b7e8-a048da2a73aa/new-treasure-island) published in 1947. His output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well-received manga series including the children mangas [Astro Boy](https://mangadex.org/title/ca4c84bb-7272-45aa-a22d-dc1282b52372/tetsuwan-atom), [Princess Knight](https://mangadex.org/title/e492584e-566e-4a51-9bf2-9a80f8a911d9/princess-knight) and [Kimba the White Lion](https://mangadex.org/title/bad33763-70c6-40b7-8d14-190556fc55f0/jungle-emperor), and the adult-oriented series [Black Jack](https://mangadex.org/title/fd86eab2-f0f3-47d3-bce5-5628e97f37dc/black-jack), [Phoenix](https://mangadex.org/title/cc647d62-3a2c-474b-ac4e-844256ab185d/hi-no-tori), and [Buddha](https://mangadex.org/title/4e102d46-0a98-4249-8a42-98e4705b663e/buddha), all of which won several awards.\n\nTezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. "
