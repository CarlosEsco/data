   "en": "Continuation of Milk Crown, Milk Crown H, a romantic comedy with a cute plot, is by Mizuto Aqua. It is the story of Tachibana Oto, a ditzy girl who works at the Class Z dormitory as a maid to earn her school tuition. On her way to the dorm, she bumps into a gang of fighting people. When she interferes to break up the fighting, she was pushed around. A mysterious stranger, with GOD tattooed on his arm and a partly-dyed fringe, timely comes to her rescue. He turns out to be Goryukanda Jin, dormitory head of Class Z, the people considered elite to others because of the various talents they hold.  \n  \nThough not in full recognition, Oto instantly falls in love with Jin for his daring ways and the un-human like traits he holds. She soon meets the other residents of Class Z, some who seem ordinary, some who seem strange, and some who seems extraordinary. The manga goes on with her life at Class Z, as she gradually discovers each of the resident’s talents and goes through, inevitable in the manga world, obstacles and seemly wrong decisions.",
