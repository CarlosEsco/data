    "en": "Compilation of short stories.\r\n\r\n[*] Suki ni Naru Made Matte\r\nWhenever it was break time, Hikami-kun sat at my desk and talked with his friends. I was concerned about it, but since he is a popular guy I couldn\u0026rsquo;t say anything about it. On that fateful day, I dropped Hikami-kun\u0026rsquo;s cell in the fish tank, and now I have to be his slave?!\r\n\r\n[*] Uso to Koi no Hajimari\r\nAkane does a favor for her friend, Tomoko, by agreeing to show her childhood friend, Ken-kun, around Tokyo while pretending to be Tomoko! Will she be found out? \r\n(Also published in \u0026quot;Koibana\u0026quot; anthology, Ch.4)\r\n\r\n[*] 1/3 no Kareshi\r\nKogure Yuuya takes an embarrassing picture of Fukada Rei, but he says he will only delete it if they meet again at the same place later. What will Rei do?\r\n\r\n[*] Deatta Toki ni Boku wa Mou Inai\r\nHigh school student Yuu finds herself pursued by a hot guy rather... spiritedly."
