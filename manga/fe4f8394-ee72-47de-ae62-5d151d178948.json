    "en": "For the most part, the world is a superficial place. We see only the surface, and not what\u0026rsquo;s underneath.* What would you do if there existed a person who was blessed with the memories of their past life and continued to love you deeply in this life? He, Zhou Shen Chen, was granted such an opportunity. She, Shi Yi, who carries the burdens of their memories by herself in the present, has only ever wished for one thing in her lifetime: to find a story that truly belonged only to them in both the past and present. For richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, no matter what\u0026rsquo;s on the surface, I will always return to you. **\r\n\r\n*TL Note: \u0026ldquo;皮相\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;骨\u0026rdquo; is used in this sentence, which literally translates to \u0026ldquo;skin\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bones\u0026rdquo;. Another meaning for the \u0026ldquo;骨\u0026rdquo; character can be in reference to your character/personality. Thus, the sentence is referring to the fact that the world is a shallow place, as you are only judged by your outer exterior (your skin), as most do not bother to delve further to see your inner self (your bones).\r\n\r\n**TL Note 2: The final sentence is a very waxing poem that she will forever follow him no matter what the destination is and whether he\u0026rsquo;s wealthy/prosperous or dirt poor which is akin to something we would find in a wedding vow."
