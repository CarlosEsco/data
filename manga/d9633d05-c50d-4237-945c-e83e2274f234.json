    "en": "Pa Si happened to encounter Qing\u0026rsquo;s pheromone, which smelled similar to a catnip. This encounter made Pa Si, a lover of catnip, greedy for Qing\u0026rsquo;s pheromone. With his attention and attraction only focused on Qing, he tries to stimulate Qing\u0026rsquo;s pheromones by making him angry. The road to mutual understanding is long and it would take the two of them a long time with inevitable mistakes. Pa Si only regarded Qing as a Catnip, but he also wondered...what if Qing was the one destined to him?"
