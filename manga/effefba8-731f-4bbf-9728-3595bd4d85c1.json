    "en": "Mizuki is an ordinary office worker who came to Haidar, a country in the Middle East, for business negotiations. After he arrived, he was suddenly struck by a white luxury car and fell unconscious. When he woke up, he was already in Prince Basil’s gorgeous mansion! Mizuki cannot refuse Basil’s forceful demand to treat him as his apology for the accident. Thus, he is treated with extraordinary hospitality. However, when he was too relaxed from the food and alcohol, Basil, who’s starting to like Mizuki, forced him to stay with sweet words saying, “If you let me hold you overnight, I will consider the business negotiations”. What was requested from a foreign land was a one-night pillow business!?"
