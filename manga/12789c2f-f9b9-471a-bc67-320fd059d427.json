    "en": "The number one clumsy girl in the school, Kajitsu Minori, is known for her forgetfulness and snail-like speed at everything. And being the nice and shy girl that she is, Minori is always by her two friends, the violent Ichirin Kikuko and the fortune teller Inguuji Nonomi. But one day, they learn that a swarm of alien monsters are coming to invade Earth and the duty of protecting the planet unfortunately falls into maybe the worst person for the position, Minori. Her magical wand conjures an outfit when worn, allows her to harness the devastating power of the wand. If only Minori was quicker at changing clothes, the monsters wouldn\u0026rsquo;t cause nearly as much destruction."
