    "en": "Reputation is everything in a world of icons and popularity contests. So why not score some points here and there by being the nice guy? This is the way Kang Shin-gi legitimizes the fake personality he has everyone believing. Armed with his above average looks and a (completely false) angel-like personality, he has every girl in school head over heels, and all the guys looking to him for guidance. With the exception of having a screwed up cross-dressing devil for a dad, Shin-gi\u0026rsquo;s life is absolute perfection (*cough* of lies), until one day, Um Seung-hui transfers to his school.\r\n\r\nWhile being a complete martial artist freak, she also likes to fib just a little in front of those who know her\u0026hellip; you know, like acting like she's just a scared little girl who'd play with kittens rather than break brick walls with her head! After all, how can anything go wrong when you're as cute as Seung-hui?\r\n\r\nFate has brought these two masters of lies together, and the two must battle it out to see who will be crowned the undefeated heavy-weight champion of fakeness!"
