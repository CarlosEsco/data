    "en": "Saitou, an editor at Weekly Shounen Jump is tired of his work, tired of being forced to work like a slave while receiving a small salary. He decides to be a Mangaka and dreams of getting rich quick. Then he looks for Murata Yuusuke, Mangaka of \u0026quot;Eyeshield 21,\u0026quot; and threatens him and gets him to teach him how to draw manga.\r\n\r\nMurata starts with the description of the basic tools, tips on how to draw a face, body, girl, etc. They also receive special guests as lecturers, like Kawashita Mizuki (Ichigo 100%), Matsui Yuusei (Nougami Neuro), and Shimabukuro Mitsutoshi (Toriko)."
