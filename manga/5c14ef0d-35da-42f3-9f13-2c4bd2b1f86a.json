    "en": "How do you distinguish between the love from a cute neighborhood girl (who\u0026rsquo;s like a little sister to you), and the love from the hottest, yet quirky, girl in school? This is exactly the question Myung-Ho has to ponder when both his neighbor\u0026rsquo;s cute little daughter, Ji-Hae, and his school\u0026rsquo;s most popular diva, Yu-Ri, make him their valentines. Of course he cares for Ji-Hae, because the poor girl\u0026rsquo;s already been through so much for someone her age, but still, she\u0026rsquo;s only just a kid. Then there\u0026rsquo;s Yu-Ri, the girl of his dreams\u0026hellip;or rather, she would be if she wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fortune-telling voodoo witch doctor. Oh and yes, it would also help if her father, the local gangster boss, wasn\u0026rsquo;t out to kill him.\r\n\r\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re as lucky as Myung-Ho is(?) choices are very hard to make. On one hand, he could go out with Yu-Ri by turning down Ji-Hae, breaking the heart of a child who\u0026rsquo;s been depending on him ever since she moved in next door. Or, he could choose Ji-Hae by turning down the only chance at romance with a beautiful girl dead set on making him her destined love. Choices, choices\u0026hellip;"
