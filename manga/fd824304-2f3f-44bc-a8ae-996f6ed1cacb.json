     "en": "Paraphrased from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genpei_Akasegawa):\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Akasegawa became involved within the Neo-Dada movement, along with Ushio Shinohara, Shusaku Arakawa, and Yoshimura Masanobu. Akasegawa was also associated with the avant-garde.\n\nIn January 1963, Akasegawa sent out invitations to a solo exhibition in the form of 1,000 yen notes with information regarding the exhibit on their backs. The following year, he was indicted for creating imitations of banknotes stemming from the 1894 Law Controlling the Imitation of Currency and Securities and was eventually convicted and given a 3 months suspended sentence for what was dubbed the \"Thousand-Yen Bill Incident.\"\n\nHis satirical manga, Sakura Illustrated, was originally published in the Asahi Journal (a weekly news magazine). Editorial disputes over its content led to a recall of one issue of the magazine, and led to a complete reorganization of its editorial board, cancelling publication the magazine for the following two weeks.\n\nHe writes humorous essays and other literary works under the pen name Otsuji Katsuhiko.\n\nPassed away on October 26, 2014.

     "en": "Made his debut in Garo in 1971 with a story called \"Kan no Mushi\" [Irascible], about a incorrigibly bad boy whose mother takes him to a sadistic accupuncturist for a \"cure\".\n\nKazuichi Hanawa is one of Japan's most revered and imitated mangaka. His macabre, erotic tales of medieval aristocracy are, in their cruely humorous depictions of late Heian-period decadence, reminiscent of the early fiction of Jun'ichiro Tanizaki. Hanawa was born April 17, 1947. He debuted as a mangaka in Garo's July 1971 issue, and his work was an instant sensation. After the death of his mother in the early eighties, Hanawa quit drawing manga and retired to his hometown in rural Saitama. There, he lived the life of a farmer while reading works on Buddhism, yoga, and psychology. He was lured back to manga in 1984 by the legendary editor Hiroshi Yaku to contribute a thirty-four page story for the debut issue of Comic Baku. Yaku remembers Hanawa at that time as a nervous man, whose morbid fear of meeting people bordered on paranoia. \"If people around here knew I was a mangaka\", he told Yaku, \"they'd come and throw stones at me.\" Hanawa begins a manga without any preconceived plan as to the direction his story will take. He draws image upon image, holding the theme and plot together with only his enourmous powers of concentration. He has published many collections of his work and has collaborated with Suehiro Maruo on a book of illustrations titled Muzane (Cruel Pictures). Hanwa, while living in Sapporo in Northern Japan, was raided by the police over his collection of antique weaponry. He was convicted to three years of prison (Japan has very strict gun-control law enforcement). After his release, he published the work \"In the prison\", that he drew during his imprisonment.\n\nLives in Sapporo (Hokkaidou) now."

Even then, Ikegami had the magic touch, and his first two collaborative efforts - I UEO Boy with [Koike Kazuo](https://mangadex.org/author/785c1506-618e-4829-9533-86995c04c0a4/koike-kazuo) in 1973 and Otoko Gumi in 1974 with [Kariya Tetsu](https://mangadex.org/author/4279ea10-bc91-47f9-b7a7-aca12bc4430f/kariya-tetsu) - proved so popular they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators and shows no signs of stopping.\n\nHe worked at [Mizuki Production/Mizuki Shigeru](https://mangadex.org/author/9a7709d7-c9a6-4afb-bdf9-054aec977140/mizuki-shigeru) as an assistant for about a year and a half. He is a fan of [TSUGE Yoshiharu’s](https://mangadex.org/author/0495ec83-5f94-4b89-af30-5db3238581f1/tsuge-yoshiharu) works, Ikegami was surprised when he saw Tsuge also worked at MIZUKI Shigeru’s place.\n\nIkegami once applied to be an assistant to [SATO Masaaki](https://mangadex.org/author/ec701ae7-65a4-4fcc-884c-bee29d3baaac/satou-masaki) \u0026 [SAITO Takao](https://mangadex.org/author/bc302292-841c-42b1-962d-bcb41d427ae2/saito-takao) but they already had enough assistants at that time.\n\n[FUJIWARA Yoshihide](https://mangadex.org/author/d4bd7c05-4986-424a-99d1-30d7d56daa95/fujiwara-yoshihide), [Akiha @](https://mangadex.org/author/4a3fbf8e-d386-400b-b167-7eb729c44e3d/akiha), MATSUHISA Yuu, and SATA Misaki were once his assistants.\n\nSource: [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=930)"

One of the pioneers of the *gekiga* genre, he was well-known for his social critique and realistic drawing style. He debuted as a mangaka in 1957, and began publishing his first popular and long-running series *Ninja Bugeichou* in 1959. \n\nIn 1964, he helped Katsuchi Nagai found the manga anthology magazine *Garo*; the first story published in the magazine was his series *Kamui*, which is often considered his most important and influential work. Deeply influenced by marxism, the series touches upon the inherent discriminations that can be found in a feudal society and is a denounciation of the treatment of the *burakumin*, a Japanese social minority.\n\n*Kamui* ran until 1971, and was then restarted in 1988 in the magazine *Big Comic*, for which Sanpei had worked in the meantime.\n\nShirato Sanpei passed away on October 8th, 2021 due to aspiration pneumonia. His brother, Okamoto Tetsuji, who had worked with him as his assistant, passed away four days later of interstitial pneumonia."

Akasegawa was also associated with the avant-garde.\n\nIn January 1963, Akasegawa sent out invitations to a solo exhibition in the form of 1,000 yen notes with information regarding the exhibit on their backs. The following year, he was indicted for creating imitations of banknotes stemming from the 1894 Law Controlling the Imitation of Currency and Securities and was eventually convicted and given a 3 months suspended sentence for what was dubbed the \"Thousand-Yen Bill Incident.\"\n\nHis satirical manga, Sakura Illustrated, was originally published in the Asahi Journal (a weekly news magazine). Editorial disputes over its content led to a recall of one issue of the magazine, and led to a complete reorganization of its editorial board, cancelling publication the magazine for the following two weeks.\n\nHe writes humorous essays and other literary works under the pen name Otsuji Katsuhiko.\n\nPassed away on October 26, 2014.

His macabre, erotic tales of medieval aristocracy are, in their cruely humorous depictions of late Heian-period decadence, reminiscent of the early fiction of Jun'ichiro Tanizaki. Hanawa was born April 17, 1947. He debuted as a mangaka in Garo's July 1971 issue, and his work was an instant sensation. After the death of his mother in the early eighties, Hanawa quit drawing manga and retired to his hometown in rural Saitama. There, he lived the life of a farmer while reading works on Buddhism, yoga, and psychology. He was lured back to manga in 1984 by the legendary editor Hiroshi Yaku to contribute a thirty-four page story for the debut issue of Comic Baku. Yaku remembers Hanawa at that time as a nervous man, whose morbid fear of meeting people bordered on paranoia. \"If people around here knew I was a mangaka\", he told Yaku, \"they'd come and throw stones at me.\" Hanawa begins a manga without any preconceived plan as to the direction his story will take. He draws image upon image, holding the theme and plot together with only his enourmous powers of concentration. He has published many collections of his work and has collaborated with Suehiro Maruo on a book of illustrations titled Muzane (Cruel Pictures). Hanwa, while living in Sapporo in Northern Japan, was raided by the police over his collection of antique weaponry. He was convicted to three years of prison (Japan has very strict gun-control law enforcement). After his release, he published the work \"In the prison\", that he drew during his imprisonment.\n\nLives in Sapporo (Hokkaidou) now."

Although many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators and shows no signs of stopping.\n\nHe worked at [Mizuki Production/Mizuki Shigeru](https://mangadex.org/author/9a7709d7-c9a6-4afb-bdf9-054aec977140/mizuki-shigeru) as an assistant for about a year and a half.

One of the pioneers of the *gekiga* genre, he was well-known for his social critique and realistic drawing style. He debuted as a mangaka in 1957, and began publishing his first popular and long-running series *Ninja Bugeichou* in 1959. \n\nIn 1964, he helped Katsuchi Nagai found the manga anthology magazine *Garo*; the first story published in the magazine was his series *Kamui*, which is often considered his most important and influential work. Deeply influenced by marxism, the series touches upon the inherent discriminations that can be found in a feudal society and is a denounciation of the treatment of the *burakumin*, a Japanese social minority.\n\n*Kamui* ran until 1971, and was then restarted in 1988 in the magazine *Big Comic*, for which Sanpei had worked in the meantime.\n\nShirato Sanpei passed away on October 8th, 2021 due to aspiration pneumonia. His brother, Okamoto Tetsuji, who had worked with him as his assistant, passed away four days later of interstitial pneumonia."
