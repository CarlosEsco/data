    "en": "Six years ago, Ye Ling Xi decided to escape from Sheng Nan Heng's world, dragging an exhausted body and scarred heart with her. Six years later, they ran into each other again due to an accident. One is still in love with the other but keeps running away, while the other one keeps pursuing strongly but remains domineering and reserved. Will their identities become obstacles in getting back together? What truths are hidden behind the misunderstanding that they couldn't be honest about? How does one reverse the breakup progress bar? How does one end the countdown of reconciliation?"
