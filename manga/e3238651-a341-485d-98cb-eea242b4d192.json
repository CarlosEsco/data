   "en": "Losing her wallet on the first day in high school, Midori is helped by Ichijou Rei who is in the same class as her. She waits for a chance to express her gratitude but, he and his 2 friends don’t show up to school… Through rumours, she discovers that the 3 of them have been suspended from school due to causing certain problems…?! Amidst that, Midori ends up being caught by her school director for working part-time, something that is banned by the school!! The result would be a suspension and cancellation of her scholarship but, the director gives her an ultimatum in exchange: “I want you to bring them back to school.” This is the beginning of heart-racing school days with a group of 3 problematic, handsome boys!"
