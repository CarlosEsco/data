    "en": "Tokitou Haruto, during his first year in middle school, lost all of his friends because of a Science Fiction novel he had read. He was so engrossed in the novel that he started calling men \u0026ldquo;Kei\u0026rdquo; and the ladies \u0026ldquo;Fr\u0026auml;ulein,\u0026rdquo; which had spread throughout the school at that time. Unable to cope with the sudden exclusion, Haruto continued to isolate himself throughout his middle school years.\r\n\r\nNow, as a first year high schooler, Haruto faces a new \u0026ldquo;problem.\u0026rdquo; One casual day at school, the classroom becomes perfectly still. Time has stopped again. Having experienced this time-stop multiple times, Haruto begins to wonder if this time-stop is actually a dream. But all of this doubt stops when he meets Sakazaki Kuon, someone else who knows and experiences the time-stop. She is also part of a team of members who defends the world from monsters who attack the world using this time-stop dimension: Kohakjal. What relation does Haruto have with a group who fends off time-stop monsters? Could it be that he's the only who can truly fight them off?"
