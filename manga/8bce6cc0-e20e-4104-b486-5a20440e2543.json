   "en": "Hayun, who was struggling on his own, rescued a Persian cat who was almost hit by a car.   \n  \nIt was a good deed without any meaning, but the cat brought a long-haired woman lying naked in front of her house as if she were boeun.  \n  \nHayun misunderstood her as a fan and tried to kick her out. However, she insisted that she was a guardian angel and persisted around Hayun.  \n  \nShe speaks and acts very differently compared to ordinary people.   \n  \nWhen the situation is twisted, Hayun is forced to hire her as a manager and live together. Habi is the cat that brought her along.  \n  \nBut the more I look at this woman, the more difficult it is.   \n  \nIs she really… an angel?"
