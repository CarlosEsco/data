   "en": "Baki Hanma is a generally happy student with a rather odd hobby; he likes fighting. Specifically, he likes fighting in a secret martial arts tournament that gathers the greatest fighters of the world and pits them against each other in really nasty combat. Whether you're a sumo wrestler, a karate expert, or a guy who specializes in ripping out your opponent's nerves, you're welcome to participate (as long as you can keep quiet about it, of course). Anyway, Baki may be the youngest fighter the tournament has ever seen, but he's also the best, and he really enjoys what he does.  \n   \nAnimeNewsNetwork Links:  \n[Season 1](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2035)  \n[Season 2](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2036)"
