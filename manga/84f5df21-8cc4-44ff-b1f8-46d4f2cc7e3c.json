    "en": "Debochi Amon (14) was always a passionate boy and had a tendency to literally steam up. Amon was living a normal life; going to school, hanging with friends and thinking about his crush on his classmate, Shinomoto Sako. One day, a third eye opens on his forehead after one of his usual “steaming” incidents and a talking owl creature who calls himself Goomin appears. Both characters are confused at the situation at hand and Goomin finally is able to explain the situation to Amon. Amon now possesses Pyrokinesis and his power of his fire increases when his passion grows. His emotion of wanting to protect something, like his crush Shinomoto, triggers the transformation into a demonic figure and his flame is powered through greed. Now, Amon must learn to control and use his powers to protect the human world from Angels!"
