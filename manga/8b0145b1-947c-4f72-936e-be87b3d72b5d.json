    "en": "In the future, Earth has become so polluted that humanity is forced to live in enclosed shelters. In Japan, the shelters are divided between the \"inside\", which caters to the country's lucrative anime industry, and the \"outside\", where most people work to support the people working on the \"inside\". S-zawa is one such \"outside\" worker whose job involves sending messages into space. One day, he's approached by the ailing embodiment of Earth to send a message before she collapses. Shortly after the message is sent, other girls similar to Earth start showing up at S-zawa's workplace in an effort to help Earth, but he has a thing or two to learn about what the planets and their moons are really like."
