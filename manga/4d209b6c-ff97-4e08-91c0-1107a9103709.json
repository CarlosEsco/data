    "en": "Omega college student Shizuki Tsugaya feared the worst when he goes into heat while walking down the street and attracts a nearby Alpha, but he is unexpectedly saved - by his own attacker! Shizuki is impressed by the handsome man's ability to fight his instincts and regain his self-control, especially since his own instincts are telling him that this person is his fated pair. When he learns that his new prince charming is the president of a modeling company, Shizuki immediately applies for a job there, determined to be close to him. Can he convince his new employer that the two of them were meant to be together?"
