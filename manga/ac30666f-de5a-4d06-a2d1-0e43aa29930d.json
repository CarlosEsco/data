    "en": "Let's go catch a dream!\r\nMarimo Tateyama, the daughter of a tackle shop, is a high school girl who lives with her grandmother. She was a first class fisher, but, as a result of an accident, she refuses to allow herself to pursue \u0026quot;dreams and romance\u0026quot; in fishing. One day, Tetra, a girl from the United States, came to visit Marimo, who she idolized, and declared that she would beat Marimo and become the best angler in the world at the next Olympics.\r\nThe future of these two girls unfolds through high stakes fishing competitions!"
