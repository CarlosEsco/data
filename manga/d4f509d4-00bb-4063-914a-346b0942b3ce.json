    "en": "A new girl who came to the house of a high school student, Kamisawa Kazusa, is a little girl who says she is a god of marriage. The name is Noko. It seems that Wasa must grow up to be a fine god, even though she is an immature god. Even if you say that suddenly, I have never raised a child, and I don't know how God should be raised. However, if you are raised properly, you will be able to tie the relationship with your classmate, Shiina-san, who admires Wasa. I don't want to take care of my child! But I want to be connected with Shiina! A high school student's child-rearing struggle with love and parenting !?"
