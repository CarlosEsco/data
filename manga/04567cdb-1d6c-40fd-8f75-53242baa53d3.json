    "en": "Asafuji Taisei was in a car crash that killed both of his parents and left him severely injured. Despite a miraculous recovery, the prospect of a long rehabilitation process has Taisei feeling hopeless about returning to baseball. However, one day he turns on an old CRT TV that his parents had given him, and while watching the static he remembers that he promised to take his parents to Koushien. It's the spark that finally motivates him, but can Taisei really make it to Koushien after being out of baseball for two years?"
