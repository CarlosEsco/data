   "en": "Ichigo Kurosaki has always been able to see ghosts, but this ability doesn't change his life nearly as much as his close encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper and member of the mysterious Soul Society. While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family, but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy.   \nNow a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits, and along with Rukia, who is slowly regaining her powers, it's Ichigo's job to both protect the innocent from Hollows and to help the spirits themselves find peace.   \n\n---\n  \nWon the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award in the Shounen category.  \n  \nThe following link takes you to ANN for the various anime, movies, OAVs, etc.:  \n[AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2468)  \n  \n**Official English 2:**  \n\u003chttps://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100004\u003e",

     "en": "His real name is Kubo Noriaki.\n\nHe started drawing manga because he liked GeGeGe no Kitaro and Saint Seiya as a child.\n\nThe son of a town council member in Fuchu, Aki District, Hiroshima, Kubo graduated from the local high school and went on to Anabuki Design College in Hiroshima City but dropped out. In an interview, Kubo has stated that he entered a magazine's manga contest, and that although he did not win, one of the magazine's editors noticed his talent. They subsequently worked together on joint projects. Not long afterward, his first manga short, \"Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine\", was published in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump Special in 1996. This was followed by two more shorts, and in 1999 his first serial, Zombie Powder, began in Weekly Shonen Jump and ran for four volumes until 2000.\n\nHis next serial, Bleach, about a high school student who becomes a shinigami and fights evil spirits, Kubo submitted a manuscript of Bleach to Weekly Shonen Jump shortly after Zombie Powder ended hoping that it would be published; the story was rejected, since the editors claimed it was too similar to Togashi Yoshihiro’s YuYu Hakusho. Toriyama Akira, the creator of Dragon Ball, saw the story and sent a letter of encouragement to Kubo which inspired him to continue working on Bleach. The serialization began running in the same magazine in 2001, and an anime adaptation began running in Japan in 2004. The manga was named a winner of the Shogakukan Manga Award for its category in 2005."
