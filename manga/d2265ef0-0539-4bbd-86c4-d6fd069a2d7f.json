    "en": "Monoko is a monochrome girl living in a monochrome desert. She\u0026rsquo;s never seen any color besides white and black. But one day, a girl called Madotsuki appears in front of her, covered in a lot of different colors.This one shot was uploaded to pixiv by Jirou-san, and it\u0026rsquo;s inspired by the game Yume Nikki, by kikiyama. Instead of giving a broad view of the events in the game, it focuses on the relationship between Madotsuki and Monoko."
