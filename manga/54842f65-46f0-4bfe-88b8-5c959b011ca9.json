    "en": "From NetComics:\r\n\r\n3H Before Kiss is a romance story about the struggles involved in maintaining a long-distance relationship. Keiko and Shun are a young couple only able to visit each other once a month. During these visits, they make sure to make up for lost time in as many pleasurable-and increasingly creative-ways as possible. When Keiko finds a receipt from a love hotel in her boyfriend Shun's pocket, however-a hotel that she has never visited-doubt and suspicion begin to take hold of her imagination. Her worst fears seem to be confirmed when Shun mentions his new \u0026quot;friend\u0026quot; Kiku, a pretty, flirtatious girl in Shun's music club who is all too popular with the boys. Keiko, meanwhile, has her own share of trouble resisting temptation while Shun is away. Told from both lovers' perspectives, Three Times Before the Kiss is a stark, frank story that humorously portrays the familiar world of college romance."
