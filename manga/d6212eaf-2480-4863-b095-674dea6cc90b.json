    "en": "Her classmates were always intimidated by her height, hence she received the nickname of \u0026ldquo;Big Sister\u0026rdquo; for sixteen years. But this is far from the truth! She not only is a coward who doesn\u0026rsquo;t dare to say what\u0026rsquo;s on her mind, she\u0026rsquo;s also super scared of horror movies! Like every girl in love, for the sake of the guy she likes, she volunteered to be on the committee of the school\u0026rsquo;s cultural festival. \r\nUnfortunately, her class then chose \u0026ldquo;haunted house\u0026rdquo; as their theme; how will she get through this now?\r\n\r\nContents:\r\n[*] Hetare Venus (Clumsy Goddess)\r\n[*] 1 Day, 1 Kiss \r\n[*] Tsuki ni Todokutou (Tower That Reaches the Moon) \r\n[*] Yami e Hakobu Elevator (The Elevator that Takes you Into Darkness)\r\n\u0026quot;There's something coming from the other side of the darkness...\u0026quot;\r\nA teenage girl is recommended by her friend to take the test of courage at an unused hospital, but something sinister is going on there...\r\n[*] Watashi no Sweet Love Taiken (My Sweet Love Experience)"
