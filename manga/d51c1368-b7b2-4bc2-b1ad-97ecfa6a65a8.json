However, can a demon and a priest find love?\r\n\r\n2: Akuma no Himitsu\r\nA continuation of the romance between Raoul and the Father. After a long search, Raoul's brother finally locates him and ultimately answers the question: What exactly is Raoul?\r\n\r\n3: Muda na Koto Shimasho!\r\nShuuji is a guy who hates to do unproductive things. He definitely doesn't get homosexuality, because in his mind, procreation is the purpose of sex. When he is hit on by a boy on the street, he punches him. Unfortunately for Shuuji, the boy, Sawatari, is a student at the school where Shuuji is starting his student teaching the next day. The practical, serious Shuuji may have well have met his match in the playful, flirtatious Sawatari.\r\n\r\n4: Yuki ga Kuru Mae ni\r\n\u0026quot;If I were a girl, I would fall head over heels for you\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; used to say Tomono jokingly to his buddy Yuba \u0026ndash; until he found out that Yuba did not particularly mind that Tomono is not a girl\u0026hellip;\r\n\r\n5: Akumatachi no Himitsu\r\nContinuation of Akuma no Himitsu and Akuma no Sasayaki, this time focusing on Baldur, Raoul's older demon brother, and another incubi, Zahan."
