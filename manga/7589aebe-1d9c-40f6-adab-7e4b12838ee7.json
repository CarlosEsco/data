    "en": "\u0026quot;I want to make you cry.\u0026quot; \u0026quot;I want to make you feel this even more...\u0026quot; Ryunosuke meets Sachi, a boy famous throughout the campus for his cuteness. He looks like the prettiest girl when he dresses up in women's clothing, but in reality he's tough, scrappy, and downright righteous. Ryunosuke is enticed by the contrast between these two sides of Sachi, and bumps into him after Sachi gets slipped a mickey at the school festival. The drug's really hitting Sachi hard, and Ryunosuke approaches him, telling him that he'll feel better right away if he does as Ryunosuke says. Seeing Sachi flushed and teary-eyed brings out the worst in Ryunosuke, who can't help saying things to toy with him, but then...!?  from Renta!"
