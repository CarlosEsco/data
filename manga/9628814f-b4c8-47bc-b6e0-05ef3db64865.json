    "en": "The first original Biohazard novel. The narrative is set on an island in the North Sea, known as Gadiwell which is used for secret bio-weapons research by the Beardsley family, a noble family who were part of the same circle of noblemen that founded Umbrella Pharmaceuticals. \r\nWicked North Sea can be seen as part of an expanded universe running alongside Capcom's primary canon; while Flagship's sidestories were never officially canon the ideas in them formed the basis for game storylines."
