    "en": "1. Mascara Blues\r\nMugino falls in love with any boy who \u0026quot;sparkles\u0026quot; in front of her eyes! But after they accept her confession, the \u0026quot;sparkle\u0026quot; dies. She talks about her problems to her friend, Shuuya. After seeing another guy lose his \u0026quot;sparkle\u0026quot;, Mugino goes to talk to Shuuya but finds that he has a \u0026quot;sparkle\u0026quot; too! She doesn't want to date him because she has a feeling that if his sparkle dies, then she'll have to dump him and their friendship may never be the same again.\r\n\r\n2. Draft of Romance\r\nTsuda always stares at Takasuga. But when their eyes meet, Takasuga glares at her with scary eyes. She only stares at him because she remembers a day when she was going on the bus and dropped her bag. She quickly tried to pick it up and found a guy who helped her. When she got on the bus she said \u0026quot;Thank You\u0026quot; but the doors were already closed. She was determined that Takasuga was the guy, but if he isn't...\r\n\r\n3. So I Can Be Myself - A Long Dream\r\nHikaru wakes up every morning and feels that every day's going to be a long dream.  She soon meets a hairstylist, Mashima Eiji, who asks her to be his hair model. When she tells her friends this, they warn her not to fall in love with him because hairstylists are known to \u0026quot;play\u0026quot; with their clients. But she can't stop thinking about him! Is he just going to play around with her, or will he take her seriously if she confesses her secret?"
