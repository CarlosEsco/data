   "en": "A political thriller involving a former sumo wrestler, now a member of corporate trading. \n\nAfter a scandal involving the director who promoted him, Himoto gets transferred to the city of Esecarta in the South American country of Santalna (a fictitious location). Santalna is in political turmoil, with the government fighting against rebel guerillas. However, Himoto hears about a rare mineral that can only be mined in the very location the rebel guerillas make their stronghold. Can Himoto, the 'gringo',  succeed in his goal?\n\nIncomplete due to Tezuka's death. The 11th chapter was the last finished work of Tezuka. To fill in the third tankoban, a short serial from 1987 was included."
