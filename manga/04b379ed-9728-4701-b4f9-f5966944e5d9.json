    "en": "She'd conceived his child and ran.\r\n\r\nBut there was nowhere Carmen could hide from this prince of Judar. No stone he wouldn't turn to find her, no wall he couldn't tear down. Nothing would stop Farooq Aal Masood from claiming the mother of his baby.\r\n\r\nShe had betrayed him. And she would pay. In his bed. As his wife...until he tired of her. And though Carmen professed to love him, that it was all a misunderstanding, well...Farooq would never fall for her lies again!\r\n\r\nFirst story of the Throne of Judar series."
