   "en": "Sakurai Sakuya is a first-year student that hates summer. One day when he's verbalizing his hatred towards the sky, he is spotted by Kisaragi Haruka, a second or third year student. (It's only said that she's senior to Sakuya.) Haruka is the only member of the art club of the school and ask Sakuya to model for her. He agrees not knowing it would be a nude model. Then only covered by a small blanket, Sakuya gets aroused by the thought of him and Haruka being all alone in the club room, which is an old storage shed. Haruka is entranced by Sakuya's penis and keeps touching it, which leads to have Sakuya cum all over Haruka's face. Sakuya thinks that this is the end between them, but Haruka warmly sees him off with the words \"See you tomorrow\". Thus their fragile love begins."
