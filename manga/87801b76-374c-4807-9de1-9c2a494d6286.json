Rakka Koibumi (Falling Love Letters)  \nIsa is sick and tired of confronting his tenant, Hasegawa-san who is an author, to pick up after himself and pay his rent. With the second last of his tenant leaving, Isa’s suddenly stuck with a dilemma on whether or not to continue renting the place out or sell it. But, a visit to a local bookstore maybe change his perspective and bring more excitement to his mundane daily life…"
