Zaiaku wa Hada no Ue ni (Sin Is Above Skin Level)\r\nTsukishima, a regular businessman, has begun a blissful life living with his lover Yamaji.

A springtime continuation with our lovely couple.\r\n\r\n4. Renai Tsuu (Heartache)\r\nWhen stoic Mizusawa, a janitor, saves businessman Aoki from falling down some stairs, he gets a friend for life! Aoki is always tracking him down at lunch time just so they can eat together. But Mizusawa isn't sure how he feels about Aoki...\r\n\r\n5. Renai Tsuu - Akka\r\n\r\n6. Yurusareta Uta (Permitted Song)\r\nHumans keep monsters as slaves for fighting and protection, but there is one, Zai who refuses to fight.
