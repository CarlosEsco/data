    "en": "1-2) On the Quiet\r\nOn a cold winter day, when Ikewaki Kou, a college student, forgot his key and couldn't enter his apartment, he was invited into his neighbour, Shiraishi Hiroya's room. But the room was so dirty that there wasn't even space for him to put his foot down, and Kou was really shocked by this gap from his neighbour's orderly image. Even so, Kou remembers the steady palpitation of his heart as he conversed with the bashful and unaffected Shiraishi. Things got heated when Kou realised that Shiraishi might like his brother instead.\r\n\r\n3-4) Tangerine Report\r\nNakatani is a nice guy... to everyone else in school. For some reason, he seems to hate Ikeuchi. What could be the reason? Ikeuchi finds himself drawn to Nakatani after seeing the sunlight turn his hair a beautiful color, along with an arousing desire to touch him.\r\n\u0026quot;I always smile gently, because I'm scared of being shunned.\u0026quot; Part two is told from Nakatani's point of view.\r\n\r\n5-6) Unreasonable Baby\r\nSugimoto, from Tangerine Report, is back with his own story this time. He took his friends' gay relationship very well... but why? It turns out, he's had some experience himself... with his senpai Kotegawa.\r\nSecond part told from Kotegawa's point of view."
