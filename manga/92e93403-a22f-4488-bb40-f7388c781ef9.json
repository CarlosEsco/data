    "en": "This is the sequel of [url=https://mangadex.com/manga/3867]M\u0026Auml;R[/url], it is recommended to read the prequel first.\r\n\r\nYoung Kai has been passionately idolizing Ginta ever since his heroic battle in the War Games of six years ago. Since then, \u0026Auml;RMs have become a common thing, Guardians especially! Kai himself doesn't have one though, and dreams big of being able to get an \u0026Auml;RM like Ginta's! When his caretaker, the old \u0026Auml;RM-smith that took him in after his parents' deaths, sends him out on an errand, he is attacked by a bandit from \u0026quot;chess\u0026quot;! In his escape attempt, he finds more than he bargained for when he comes across Babbo! But, now with Babbo's awakening, the fake \u0026Auml;RMs are going out of control! Is it Kai's turn to save M\u0026Auml;R-Heaven following in his hero's footsteps?"
