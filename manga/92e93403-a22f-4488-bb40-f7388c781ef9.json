   "en": "This is the sequel of [MÄR](https://mangadex.com/manga/3867), it is recommended to read the prequel first.  \n  \nYoung Kai has been passionately idolizing Ginta ever since his heroic battle in the War Games of six years ago. Since then, ÄRMs have become a common thing, Guardians especially! Kai himself doesn't have one though, and dreams big of being able to get an ÄRM like Ginta's! When his caretaker, the old ÄRM-smith that took him in after his parents' deaths, sends him out on an errand, he is attacked by a bandit from \"chess\"! In his escape attempt, he finds more than he bargained for when he comes across Babbo! But, now with Babbo's awakening, the fake ÄRMs are going out of control! Is it Kai's turn to save MÄR-Heaven following in his hero's footsteps?"
