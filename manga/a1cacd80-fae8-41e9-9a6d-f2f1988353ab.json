    "en": "Collection of short stories:\r\n\r\n[*] [b]Seibu Yuugi[/b]: In the ruins of a former civilization, crime has been on the rise. To combat it, the government instituted a bounty hunting system, like in the wild west. To prevent collateral damage, bounty hunters must attend a special school and receive a license. This story follows Ellena Fiscuff, a new student at the bounty hunter's school.\r\n[*] [b]Gekka Bijin[/b]: Kaguya is forced to flee after the moon empire she is heir to is taken over. In her time down on Earth, will she be able to find a way to return to her rightful place?\r\n[*] [b]Witch Craze[/b]: Witch hunters bearing blood-sucking swords hunt down witches and take their blood. An unusual man and woman traveling together come into a town that already has at least one witch, just before a group of hunters arrive to take her down.\r\n[* ][b]PMG-0[/b]: Tania has been a member of the PMG, the \u0026quot;musketeers\u0026quot; that form a special police guard, from the time after the violent death of her father. She's not very disciplined, but she's a force to be reckoned with. In this story, PMG is trying to stop a group of armed robbers."
