    "en": "It\u0026rsquo;s been eight months since Kakurai, CEO of a preeminent domestic apparel enterprise, last had a vacation, when he meets a pickpocket. That pickpocket turns out to be a young man named Kei. Upon meeting Kei, with his sharp, rebellious eyes, Kakurai\u0026rsquo;s attracted to him, so he decides to take Kei along with him. At first, Kei acts like a wounded and cautious animal towards Kakurai, but then, seeing Kakurai\u0026rsquo;s mature behavior and sincere attitude, he begins to open his heart. Will the adult who has everything-social status, reputation, money, etc- finally be able to encounter his true love for whom he\u0026rsquo;d throw it all away?!"
