Masato always dreamt about Akihiro pampering him in bed. However, Akihiro was really holding him in bed when he woke up one morning and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember what happened the night before. Was it a dream or reality that really happened?\r\n\r\n3) Be Conscious Even If You're Asleep\r\nIt's common for Takao, Akihiro's manager, to wake up and find a naked woman in his bed. But after a drinking party, he wakes up to find a naked man (Andou) sleeping next to him... even worse, it's someone he knows! Takao goes back to sleep and ends up brushing it off as a dream... buuut, what about Andou?\r\n\r\n4) A Cowardly Man\r\nAkiduki-san is always yelling at his kouhai Kagami, but he secretly loves him. When their manager tells Kagami to set Akiduki up on a goukon, the whole thing ends up with the two guys kissing. The next day Kagami apologizes... where does that leave Akiduki?\r\n\r\n5) Bandaids\r\nInfirmary sensei Fuwa is in love with his co-worker, Amaki. When one of the students comes crying to the infirmary because Amaki said has a girlfriend, Fuwa is dejected; but then, Amaki touches his hand..."
