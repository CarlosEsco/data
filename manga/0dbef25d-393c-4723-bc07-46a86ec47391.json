   "en": "1-2) Dripping of Love  \nMaya and Narusawa, college students at the same university, start sleeping together in what was supposed to be a purely physical relationship. Maya, however, starts to fall deeper into the relationship and has started to want more. Will real love mess up the relationship they have now? The bittersweet story of two people troubled by love.  \n  \n3) The Distance That Your Voice Touches  \nMiyakawa's upstairs neighbor Tsukasa is always dropping things onto his balcony, and of course Miyakawa has to return them, only to be fed dinner and sexually harassed! It's getting to be too much for the poor college student.  \n  \n4) I Want to Embrace  \nHigh school student Takase is unwittingly drawn to cheerful energetic Sora. But as his interest and naturally protective feelings toward his friend become something deeper and more dangerous, Takase begins to pull away from Sora.  \n  \n5) Shake  \nKikusui is a waiter in a cafe with primarily female clientele, but lately a handsome man in a black suit has been coming around. Miyamamo has no sense of personal space and a crush on Kikisui.  \n  \nExtra) Voice of Answer to You  \nMaya and Narusawa.",
