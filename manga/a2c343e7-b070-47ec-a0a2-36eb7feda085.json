    "en": "At a difficult time in his childhood, Hidaka Gen was saved by a friendly breakfast restaurant called \u0026quot;Asa Meshi Mae.\u0026quot; His experience with that restaurant led him on the path of studying cooking. Years later, when Gen is in his twenties, he returns to \u0026quot;Asa Meshi Mae.\u0026quot; The restaurant is now closed, and the owner has passed away. The owner's only daughter, Sayoko, is now a divorced single mother. Gen is determined to re-open \u0026quot;Asa Meshi Mae,\u0026quot; the restaurant that has meant so much to his life!
