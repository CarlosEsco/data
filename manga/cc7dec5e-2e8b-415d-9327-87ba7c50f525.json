    "en": "Story 1: Sweet Tear is the Flavor of Love\r\nAfter a painful experience in love, Tani Rika started to have a cynical view of love. She falls in love easily, confesses her love easily, but the moment the guy tells her that he loves her, she dumps him. This time, her new target is Tanabe-sensei, a teacher at the cram school she\u0026rsquo;s going to. Making him fall for her is just another game to Rika - or so she thought, but she started to develop feelings that she thought she had forgotten a long time ago\u0026hellip;\r\n\r\nStory 2: Altair's Love Letter\r\nSueo, a countryside girl, becomes friends with Tsutsui-kun, the lonely city boy. After that, every summer he goes to see her, without fail. Sudenly, he doesn't show up, for three years! She sends him letters, but he doesn't reply. What's going on?!\r\n\r\nStory 3: The Boy from the Sleeping Country\r\nMatsuri, who has been single her whole life, is on her way home from school, when she falls down with her bicycle. She's 'helped' by a mysterious boy, who's at that place everyday... He says he's there everyday because he loves that place, but... is it really the only reason?"
