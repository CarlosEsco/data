   "en": "Certain regions of Japan were labeled \"red-light\", a term referring to areas that are officially recognized for prostitution. These areas disappeared with the transition of the era.  \n  \nYano, a writer who makes living by traveling around the few remaining local brothels, loves finding stories about these experiences. One day, he finds the only existing shop in the old red-light district of the countryside. When entering the shop for experiences, intending it to become a story for his article, he is suddenly called out by the high school boy who lives in that store:  \n  \n\"I will do it.\" Suddenly invited by a curious youth while surprising himself by saying, \"Why don't you try it?\"  \n  \n\"You, you really … There is talent needed to deceive a man.\" Crossing the two worlds in such a nostalgic space, the secret desires are colored red."
