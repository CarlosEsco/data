    "en": "1-3:\r\nShiba, a high-school student, is dating his teacher Onosaka. Things are not going well \u0026ndash; sensei has an inferiority complex because Shiba likes large-breasted girls.\r\n\r\n2-4:\r\nInuo \u0026ndash; a friend of Shiba, who's quite the player with girls \u0026ndash; finds himself in a love hotel the morning after a wild party with a boy named Natsuda. Inuo would just like to forget everything because he's definitely not gay, but Natsuda wants to be his friend so badly that he can't turn him down. Natsuda turns out to be a cheerful and engaging companion, and Inuo starts to spend more and more time with him. But when he finds himself embracing Natsuda again, he pushes him away \u0026ndash; because he's definitely not gay!\r\n\r\n5:\r\nKeisuke, Shiba's brother, was kissed by friend Aki. Aki wants to do more than kiss, but Keisuke only went along with the kissing because it was Aki who asked him. So now that summer break has arrived he avoids Aki. But when Aki stops calling and avoids him in turn, he's not happy at all.\r\n\r\n6:\r\nYuki and Kaneda are childhood friends, neighbours, and more, but Yuki never seems to have time for Kaneda.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Polish / Polski:[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]Historia opowiada o miłości pomiędzy studentem a nauczycielem. Jednak nie wszystko układa się między nimi dobrze, gdyż nauczyciel nie może pogodzić się z myślą, że jego partner ma fetysz dużych piersi."
