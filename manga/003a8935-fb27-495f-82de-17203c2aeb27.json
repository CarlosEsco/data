    "en": "1. Midara na Senritsu Hiwai na Yubisaki (Lewd Melody Obscene Fingers) by SHINJO Mayu\r\nYurika has grown so used to doing what others tell her to do that she never realized she was like a caged bird. She accepted it as a matter of course when arrangements were made for her to get engaged to Satoshi, her controlling piano teacher. That is until piano genius and fringe element Hibiki teaches Yurika how to put emotion in her music--how to fly from her cage--among other less innocent things...\r\n(Also included in Motto Oshiete)\r\n\r\n2. Hyoutenka no Maria by MINAMI Kanan\r\nA story about a girl named Miona who saved the drunken university student Rikuya from freezing to death. To thank her, he takes her to an amusement park... they get along very well and Miona kinda fell in love with him. Next day she sees on tv that a female student from the same university as Rikuya was stabbed... and she begins to think that it was him...\r\n\r\n3. Abunai Houkenshitsu (Dangerous Health Room) by AYUKAWA Mio\r\nFujimori-sensei has a secret that involves the health room. Could he be meeting someone there...!?\r\n\r\n4.

Kakusei Full Moon (Full Moon Awakening) by YUUHI Ryuu\r\nYuzuki and Takara are childhood friends and so close that people consider Takara to be Yuzuki's girlfriend. But it's all in good fun--because Yuzuki is eighteen and Takara is only thirteen. Now that Takara's body is maturing, though, the joke isn't as easy to brush off as it once was...especially with a full moon pulling Yuzuki's desires to the surface.\r\n\r\n7.
