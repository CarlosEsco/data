    "en": "\"Idol\" is the \"hope\" of the world. \r\nNurturing such idols, there is a genius producer called Makoto Terada who sends out a number of hit songs to the world.\r\nBut even for such a brilliant genius living in a glittering world, \"death\" comes equally...\r\nA disease named \"cancer\".\r\nTo Makoto who was putting everything into idol training, he can't afford to consider his own condition,\r\nwhen he noticed, his whole body is already fucked,\r\nthere is no way to save him from the reaper except \"miracle\"\r\n\r\nIt was a desperate situation...\r\nHowever, Makoto choose to fight for that despair.\r\n...But his choice is not “medical treatment”\r\nhe keeps going on being a \"Producer\" until the end.\r\n\r\nAmong the idols that he produces,\r\nthere is 5-Idol unit \"SIGNUM\" which can be said to be a masterpiece.\r\nIt’s just their passing point,\r\nsuccessful dome concert is their current destination,\r\nand that is his only hope to live.\r\n\r\nAnd today, one day of life, when the curtain of the concert rises,\r\nlike burning the shining idols on the retina,\r\nand a singing voice appropriate for a diva on the eardrum,\r\nMakoto listen to \"SIGNUM\" from the audience seats.\r\n\"There's no regret... I've done it... I can laugh...\"\r\nBut after thought so strongly, he obsessed to live,\r\n\"I want to live\" he wishes,\r\nAnd the \"man\" who overworked himself to the limit,\r\ndied that day...\r\n\r\n\r\n...that should have happened, but!!"
