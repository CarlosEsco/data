    "en": "Take one Ronin, an academic failure, and drop him into a dormitory where 5 women reside. Add a little clumsiness and what do you get? Humpty Dumpty? The Three Stooges? Well...sort of. Keitaro Urashima is a dunce. He's been trying forever to get into Tokyo U with little success and what's worse, his parents kick him out the door. When turning to his grandmother Hinata for help, he stumbles upon a group of crazy women whose worlds he turns upside-down. And maybe he does get a little love in the end, if the giant onions and earthenware don't kill him first. Of course...that's after the ladies are through with him. This is a humorous tale of a guy surrounded by women who strives to make into college while being kicked in the face with a lot of hard-knock love on the way."
