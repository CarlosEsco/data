    "en": "Ari is a brand new first-year high school student. Shortly before school starts, she sees a band holding a mini outdoor concert. She is struck by how great the music is. That band, Sunnyside, is currently the hottest indie group. AND, the really cute lead singer, Youta-kun, is a student at Ari\u0026rsquo;s new school! Even better, he is in her grade, and they will be in the same class! However, Youta-kun is really popular with the girls, and he happily lets them hang all over him, like he\u0026rsquo;s dating them all! Youta-kun becomes really interested in Ari\u0026rsquo;s piano playing and makes an instant decision \u0026ndash; Ari must be Sunnyside\u0026rsquo;s new keyboardist!"
