    "en": "The manga's story centers on a woman named Haiji, whose eccentric grandfather has just passed away, and left her his mountain cabin. Her grandfather worked with a man named Kirishima, who didn't fit Haiji's image of mountaineers at all. Haiji plans to visit the mountain cabin, but finds difficulty with the unforgiving climb. Once she makes it, the sight she sees changes her, and she makes a decision. [ANN]"
