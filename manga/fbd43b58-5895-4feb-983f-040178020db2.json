   "en": "The mighty Kingdom of Goguryeo is in the midst of a war which has raged on for decades. In need of talented warriors to help lead their people, O’Rhang Yhun is sent on a mission by his master into enemy territory to find and bring back his eldest brother. However, just as O’Rhang departs on his mission, his master, a renown warrior and general of Goguryeo, passes away. Unfortunately for O’Rhang, his 2nd eldest brother has always been jealous of his martial arts potential and betrays O’Rhang by branding him as a traitor defecting to the enemy. Having been branded a traitor, he is pursued and nearly killed. As fate would have it though, O’Rhang is able to escape from his homeland barely managing to survive when a maiden as beautiful and graceful as an angel saves his life."
