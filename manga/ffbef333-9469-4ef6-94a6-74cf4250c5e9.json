    "en": "Jun Wantabe is your average outcast. He\u0026rsquo;s a third year in Highschool, but he looks like a first year. He wants to play soccer, but he sucks at sports. And to top it all off....... he\u0026rsquo;s gay. However, when Akihiro, the school giant, comes to his rescue, Jun finds out that looks can be deceiving, first loves are often full of misunderstandings, and what matters most, is now how you look, but what\u0026rsquo;s inside your heart."
