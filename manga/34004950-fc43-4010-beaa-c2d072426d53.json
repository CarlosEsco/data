    "en": "\"There's no way she's a virgin, right?\"\r\n\r\nKazumi is a 28-year-old career woman. She's single and a virgin who wears her hair casually pulled back just to have it out of the way and is very self-conscious of her tomboy personality. But for some reason, a handsome up-and-coming star at a client firm asks her out to dinner! Realizing it might be her one and only chance to change who she is, Kazumi accepts the invitation... only to find out that the place her date had in mind to \"relax after dinner\" is a hotel room! She's uncomfortable with her body, yet he passionately pursues. His lips and fingers press. She falters, wondering if this is love. But then he whispers in her ear, gentle yet cold, \"You see now? You don't need love to do things like this.\"\r\n\r\nA new romance story begins, full of all sorts of first times, misunderstandings, and near-misses!!"
