Chieko was sent to the home of Yanagizawa Sanae, a young female writer, whose aunt was worried about her sloppiness and hired her. She starts off on good footing and her warm personality makes it easier to blend in with the community. Chieko begins making friends in the new town, especially with Sanae and the Taro, the grown man with cat ears and a tail that lives with them. \u0026ensp;(From: MU)"
