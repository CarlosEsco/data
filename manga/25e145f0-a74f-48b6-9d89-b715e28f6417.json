   "en": "According to the god’s prophecy, the girl Flamm was chosen to be one of the members of the demon king’s subjugation journey. Everyone was a hero and possessed a top class power. However, for some reason only Flamm did not possess the power to fight, and all of her status values were 0. While being ashamed, she continued to put great efforts to be useful to the heroes.   \n  \nHowever, one day, she was tricked by one of the party members, said that she “was not necessary anymore,” and sold off to a slave trader. Flamm was forced to live within a coarse environment as a slave. However, there she encountered a “cursed sword,” and realized the true value of the weakest power “Inverse.”   \nThe girl, who acquired the power to fight, was honestly indifferent to the demon king already and decided to live peacefully as an adventurer alongside a girl slave she met.   \n  \n——This is a story of one girl who continued to crawl up from the very bottom in order to regain her peaceful everyday life.  \n  \nAlternate Description:  \n||\"…It's fine if I want to live.\"  \n  \nFlamme was chosen to join the hero's party even though all her stats were zero. The only thing she had was an ability with no known effects, \"Inversion.\" It was completely worthless in combat, but even still, she wasn't discouraged and did whatever she could for the party. However, the famous genius sage Jean was unsympathetic and did whatever he could to drive her out, finally resorting to selling her into slavery.  \n  \nEven at the slave shop, Flamme was persecuted endlessly, finally being fed to horrific monsters just to serve as entertainment. However, when she picked up the \"Cursed Greatsword\" that was supposed to melt her body away, her life was quickly 'inverted.'  \n  \nThe curse turned into a blessing, and her despair became inverted—this was the start of a dark fantasy interwoven between two young girls!||"
