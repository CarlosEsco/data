   "en": "“Do you choose obedience, or death?”\n\nBorn within the Lascaris Empire, which once stood at the pinnacle of success and glory, is the story of one princess who was condemned by all for her commoner lineage. No stranger to ill treatment from those around her, Irene, the princess of the Lascaris Empire, was seen only as the result of the infidelity between the late emperor and her dancer of a mother.\n\nOne fateful day, she was ordered to be wed and act as a hostage to ward off an invasion from their enemy nation, the Kingdom of Farooq. When she refused and planned to escape, it led to the death of her closest cousin. With vengeance etched in her heart, she was sent to the Kingdom of Farooq with a grudge against her mother country as she appeared before the King.\n\nKing Jafar, with his jet black hair and those striking amber eyes.\n\nOn the same night she was welcomed as a consort of a foreign land, Irene pointed a sword at Jafar…?!\n\nUnable to see the true motive behind Irene’s assassination attempt, Jafar found himself drawn to her. He had to have her at all costs, even if it meant forcefully shortening the distance between them…\n\n(Synopsis: Gourmet Scans)"
