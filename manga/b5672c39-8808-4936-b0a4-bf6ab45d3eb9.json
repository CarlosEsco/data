Lately, Haruhiko has been fustrated, getting into more fights than usual, insulting women, and ditching Kenichi. Haruhiko can't admit his problem and Kenichi is at a loss for what to do, and soon things spiral out of control. Can their friendship survive? Or will it change forever?  \n  \nThis manga is about a couple of 17 year old guys and is set in Tokyo’s Shibuya expensive neighborhood. They have been doing everything together ever since middle school, where they became best friends. But Haruhiko cannot stand female company anymore and begins to insult them at the place they are used to going. No need to tell that they take it pretty badly and tend to get a tiny bit furious. Kenichi tries to calm things down though. The fact is that Haruhiko has something bothering himself and he cannot let Kenichi knowing about that… (from Daily Manga)  \n  \nThis manga includes two oneshots:  \n\"Tight Rope Walker\"  \nA story involving a hair stylist"
