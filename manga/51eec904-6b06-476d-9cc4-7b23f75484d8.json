   "en": "One of Go Nagai's first works, this violent period piece takes place in the 1500s and stars a talented low ranking ninja named Shishimaru. In it, Shishimaru fights against Ginnai Doma (an immortal samurai who, despite being butchered multiple times, doesn't die) because Ginnai murdered his comrades. Despite being set in historical times, it has machine guns/lasers/robots/atomic reactors with no real explanation.  \n  \n**Note:**  \nScanlator is using the 1992 Aizouban 1 volume reprint by Chuko.  \n  \nCover images below:  \n4 Volumes (Complete, by Kodansha in 1978)  \n4 Volumes (Reprint, by Asahi Sonorama in 1984)  \n1 Volume (Aizouban, by Chuko in 1992)  \n3 Volumes (Bunkoban, by Chuko in 1995)  \n2 Volumes (Konbini-ban, by Shimanaka Shoten in 2003)"

     "en": "Thanks to the success of Harenchi Gakuen, Dynamic Productions (ダイナミックプロダクション, also known as Dynamic Production or Dynamic Pro, ダイナミックプロ), was founded by Go Nagai with his brothers in April 1969. Meant to be a group to help him with his works, as a consequence Harenchi Gakuen, where he derived almost no royalties from the TV series, films, or related merchandise, Dynamic Productions became a company established to manage Nagai's relations and contractual rights of his work. Dynamic became one of the first companies to require publishers sign contracts (even today many manga are created and published only on the basis of verbal agreements).\n\n(Source: Wiki)"
