    "en": "Tenshin Ranman is a manga adapted from the Yuzu-Soft visual novel of the same name. The story revolves around Chitose Haruki, a high school student who has had immense misfortune ever since his childhood. He lives with his grandfather and his little sister, Sana, who constantly worries about his well-being more than he himself does. Due to Haruki\u0026rsquo;s bad luck, Yamabuki Aoi, his childhood friend, often gives him charms of various kinds. Haruki lives a normal (and unfortunate) life, until one day Sana finds a mysterious package delivered to their house. The package contains a deity named Unohana no Sakuya Hime, who claims that Haruki\u0026rsquo;s bad luck is a form of divine punishment his bloodline inherited. She promises to shield Haruki from it, and starts living with him."
