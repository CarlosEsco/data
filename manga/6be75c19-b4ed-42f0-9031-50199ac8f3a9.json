    "en": "When the designer in a small production company suddenly disappears, Marusu is forced to take over the job of creating logos. Unfortunately, Marusu is a sales representative who doesn't know the first thing about fonts! Luckily, Helvetica, the personification of that font, appears to guide Marusu into the world of typeface and design. This fun and educational book is the perfect way to learn about typography through the manga personification of various fonts\u0026ndash;including Futura, Arial, Optima, and more\u0026ndash;and shed light on the design behind the words readers absorb every day."
