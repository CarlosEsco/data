    "en": "\u0026quot;You smell really tasty...\u0026quot; Ogura is just a regular high schooler. One day, he bumps into the delinquent Ohgami, and notices... dog ears sprouting from his head! The startled Ogura runs away, but he's confronted the next day and learns that Ohgami is a descendant of werewolves. Although Ogura promises not to tell a single soul, the wary Ohgami starts keeping a close watch. As they spend more time alone together, they begin to form an unusual bond. Then, a half-asleep Ohgami starts touching Ogura...! This is a hot, heart-throbbing young romance between a werewolf in heat and an oblivious, pheromone-rich human boy. \r\n\r\nRelated Series:\r\nHinekure Ookami-san no Yuuwaku (Spin-Off)"
