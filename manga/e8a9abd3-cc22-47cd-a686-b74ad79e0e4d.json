    "en": "The manga is divided into three episodes: The Myth of the Laurel Tree, The Eden Garden Fantasia, and Midsummer Night's Fantasy.\r\n\r\nIn \u0026quot;The Myth of the Laurel Tree,\u0026quot; the story makes references to the story between Apollo and a nymph he met in Greek mythology, although this information is not required to enjoy the manga.\r\n\r\nLaurel and her younger sister are supposed to go to Egypt for another one of her \u0026quot;stone-collecting\u0026quot; vacations.  However, things take an unexpected turn as soon as she meets a young man named Apollo who, in many girls' eyes, may be too beautiful for words. Their chance meeting turns into a major event as Laurel's plane is then hijacked by two odd terrorists who demand the plane change course to Greece!  To makes things even weirder, the two hijackers' names are Cupid and Pan. What's going on?"
