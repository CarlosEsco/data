    "en": "An orphan, Hanyul didn\u0026rsquo;t have much in life but a dream to become a singer. That is, till he saw his best friend mercilessly murdered by someone he looked up to. Harold. Popular. Perfect. Psychopath. And rich enough to cover his tracks. On the run, Hanyul quits high school, changing his name with every new job he scrambles together. When a famous singer hears his voice and offers a chance at revenge, one question remains: can he sing?"
