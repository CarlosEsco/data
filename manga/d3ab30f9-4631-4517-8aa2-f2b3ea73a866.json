    "en": "An intense reunion and live-in romance between a former bad boy with a big-brotherly streak, and a horndog who doesn't realize how obsessive he really is! Dumped by his older boyfriend, Junichi finds himself drowning his sorrows at a gay bar. Just as he dismissed the idea of a one-night stand, he is reunited with an old friend, Shizuru, who he used to think of like a little brother. In his drunken state, Shizuru needed to be taken to a hotel, leaving Junichi no time to wonder why they were reunited in a gay bar... The moment they were alone, Shizuru pins Junichi down on the bed and suddenly forces his legs apart...! (Renta)"
