    "en": "Michizure Policy\r\nShinohara, who liked to take care of others like a mother, and Nishioka, who loved sweet things just like a kid (with big build), were good friends. Shinohara loved Nishioka, but was totally a coward when it comes to love. He always thought that \u0026ldquo;this love is impossible\u0026rdquo; and continued to be Nishioka\u0026rsquo;s good friend when he blurted out his feelings unintentionally. To Shinohara\u0026rsquo;s surprise, Nishioka accepted him and they started to go out. But Shinohara was having doubts and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to believe in Nishioka. What should Nishioka do?\r\n\r\nUten Kekkou Rule\r\nCollege finals have kept Takao and Wakamiya apart, but now, even with the bad weather, Wakamiya rushes over to Takao's apartment for... some hot love. Takao, however, does not seem to be in the mood since he is the one that does everything. Tonight, Takao wants to be the one that is made to be \u0026quot;in the mood\u0026quot;. But will Wakamiya still be in the mood after being thrown into the shower with a \u0026quot;7 minute erection\u0026quot;?"
