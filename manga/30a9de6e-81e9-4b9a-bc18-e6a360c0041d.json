    "en": "[*] Ghost wa Kiss o Kirau\r\nYuu is able to see spirits, however, she has no exorcising power, and such a thing is enough of a reason to be jilted. When the new school term comes, Oga-kun's attitude changes, especially since a spirit that drives him crazy possesses Oga-kun's seat! Moreover, the honest Oga-kun is, as a matter of fact, very handsome, highly spontaneous, and quite forgetful?!\r\n\r\n[*] Mirai kara Kita Danna-sama\r\nYuka woke up next to an unknown guy one day, telling her that he is her husband from the future! As ridiculous as his claim may be, he is indeed a guy from the future. Is he really her husband from the future? Why did he travel back in time?\r\n\r\n[*] Piano Sonata wa Uso o Tsuku\r\nKaho had always loved Akira's piano playing, but there is one problem: he is demotivated to play. In order to make him play for a Christmas event, Kaho pretended to have one of her hands broken so he can replace her. But instead he wants to spend time with her...\r\n\r\n[*] Kyou mo Kamen de Koi o Suru\r\nSakura has always been known as the veteran of love by many, but the truth is, that it's all a ruse! She met a certain handsome guy and he confessed to her, and due to peer pressure, she agrees. Can she date an experienced guy while she herself is not experienced? \r\n\r\n[*] Nita mono Doushi no Renai Jijou\r\nMao is the school's popular girl and the boy she likes is the school's popular boy Kei. The only problem is that Kei teases her excessively, and thus thinking he's doesn't like her. Mao wants Kei to confess to her, and will do whatever it takes."
