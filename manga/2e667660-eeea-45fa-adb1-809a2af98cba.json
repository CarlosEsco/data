   "en": "Jiro Matsuzawa is a primary school student. One day he meets an old man with a large trunk. The trunk contains two smaller trunks, and the old man presents one to Jiro. He tells Jiro that the trunk contained a creature that had no form, and that he must design its form and make it his pet. The creature's name is Burunga, and this old man is far more sinister than Jiro could have expected."
