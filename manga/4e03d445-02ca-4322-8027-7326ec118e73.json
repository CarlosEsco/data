    "en": "For a few years, the city of Kyoto has been the theater of a secret war opposing extreme Japanese teenagers lauding the exclusion of the gaijin (foreign people) outside of Japan, and others who defend their integration. In order to avoid an escalation of violence between rival gangs, both sides have agreed to sort out the gaijins\u0026rsquo; fate for good in an underground tournament where the best fighters from each side will have to fight against each other. The \u0026quot;Black Boat Project,\u0026quot; abbreviated as the \u0026quot;B.B. Project,\u0026quot; directly links to commandant Perry\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Black Boats\u0026rdquo;: the symbol of the arrival of the gaijin on Japanese soil\u0026hellip;\r\n\r\nFranck is a young Parisian who loves to fight. He arrives in Kyoto, supposedly to study\u0026hellip; but mostly to charm Japanese girls and spend his money in video-game rooms, his vision of the \u0026ldquo;Japanese dream.\u0026rdquo; However, his real nature comes back very fast when Franck finds himself stuck in a fight opposing hooligans against the mysterious Megumi. Without knowing it, our hero is going to become a part of the B.B. Project\u0026hellip;"
