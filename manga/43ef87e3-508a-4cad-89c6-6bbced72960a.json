    "en": "This impure relationship cannot be discovered by anyone. We cannot talk about it. That's what I thought, but... he found out.\u0026quot;\r\n\r\nTsugumi has been working for Apal Society for more than seven years. When she first started working at one of their stores, she had a really close friend who she could talk to about anything. \r\n\u0026quot;I fell in love with him, and I thought he felt the same, but when we kissed, we knew it was only a misunderstanding.\u0026quot;\r\nFive years later, she was assigned to her lover's department, and her old friend once again appeared in front of her."
