   "en": "**Volume 1-4:** 10 years have passed since Takuma lost touch with his good friend Yuki, who left for Italy to become a Cellist. Now working as a home aid, Takuma is shocked to find his next patient is none other than Yuki himself.  \n  \nYuki is now semi-blind after an accident left him injured. His eyes are trapped behind bandages until the time he undergoes surgery.   \n  \nDue to mixed feelings about their reunion, Takuma keeps his identity a secret as he tends to the injured Yuki. But how will Takuma react when he learns that his friend was in love with someone when they were kids… and still holds a torch for that person even now?  \n  \n**Volume 5:** The gorgeous and heart-pounding love story of the little devil violinist Noel, who has matured a little bit, and the cool and capable manager Donald.♡"
