    "en": "Haruma is a member of the wealthy Kagetsu family. He's decided to spread his wings and move out for college, but to his dismay, his mother has hired Shoyo Kurehashi, a bodyguard who's with him 24/7. Vowing to keep Haruma safe, Shoyo fends off a would-be groper on the subway, and in exchange for his silence about the incident, Shoyo requests Haruma himself. The innocent rich kid has his first kiss stolen by the man assigned to protect him! Earnest though he is, the awkward Haruma doesn't realize Shoyo's deepening feelings towards him. Now practically living together, Haruma fears Shoyo's gonna gobble him up!"
