    "en": "Shiwoo always used to say, \u0026ldquo;Yujin, you\u0026rsquo;re my favorite person in the whole wide world.\u0026rdquo; And Shiwoo always believed he was truly special to Yujin. After all, Shiwoo never really liked all those girls he dated, anyway. But when Yujin finally confesses his love, he finds himself rejected and alone... Years later, Shiwoo is a celebrity. The hard-to-manage celebrity gets a new manager that seems so familiar... her name is even Yujin... It takes but one night of too many drinks for Shiwoo to discover she isn\u0026rsquo;t really what she seems."
