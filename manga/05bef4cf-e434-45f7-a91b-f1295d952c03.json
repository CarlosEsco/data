    "en": "Yuuki grew used to living alone after his father died. Yet now he's living with a girl named Mikage who appeared before him and settled down in his home. Mikage just happens to be a vampire, but vampires are a little different from the legends since what she drinks isn't necessarily just blood and she can walk under the sun. Now Yuuki has to live with this vampire\u0026mdash;and to his surprise, he has antibodies against vampires that prevent him to be transformed. But because he is living with a vampire now, sometimes he gets attacks that increase his sexual desire several times\u0026mdash;and things get worse when he learns there are others vampires besides Mikage."
