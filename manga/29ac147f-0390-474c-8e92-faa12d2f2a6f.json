    "en": "Arisugawa Kiku (aka Arisu) is a Japanese high-school girl who gets really nervous around foreigners. Arisu's father is getting transferred to New York for his job, so her mother pressures her to sign up for conversational English lessons. Arisu reluctantly goes to class only to discover that she's already met Ish, one of her new instructors! The two had fought over the last can of mackerel at the 100 yen shop the day before. Despite being a rude and sarcastic guy, Ish is actually very popular... Why is it that guys with glasses are just so SEXY?!"
