   "en": "Due to a lie, Yi Xiang Nuan disappeared for five years. When she came back, her ex-boyfriend Su Chen proposed to her on their first meeting? He threatened to make her marriage life miserable, but the life after the marriage was not quite the same as what he said. Nevermind, she didn’t even care about it anyway. She just wanted to bring the person who harmed her family to justice. She buried her head in search of the truth and ignored her husband. Su Chen was very unhappy with it. Su Chen: Didn't we promise that you would hide cowardly behind me and let me protect you? You step back, let me handle it. Yi Xiang Nuan: Come on, husband, I'll try my best to support you."
