   "en": "Collection of short stories.  \n  \n1) Not with Your Mouth, but Your Eyes. (Sono Me, Kuchi hodo ni.)  \nHe is, by nature, a quiet man.  \nBut when he opens his mouth, he always gets right to the point.  \n\"In brief, would you marry me?\"  \n\"You really are an idiot!\"  \n\"I always have to interfere in your life\"  \nBut why doesn't it surprise me at all?  \nBecause he was always like that so I can't imagine him differently.  \nBecause he uses his eyes instead of his mouth.  \n  \n2) Come Closer, My Little Bird (Oide, Boku no Kotori)  \n He filled out our marriage form without my consent. Then he hands me a completed divorce form. He calls himself an irresponsible man, yet he's always by my side when I need him. What am I to think about this contradictory man?  \n  \n3) A Pure White World  \nDay after day, he takes care of me. He never leaves my side and puts up with any inconvenience I cause because of an accident, because he feels responsible. But this kindness I wish to keep to myself is built upon my selfish lie.  \n  \n4) The Gathering - Omake"
