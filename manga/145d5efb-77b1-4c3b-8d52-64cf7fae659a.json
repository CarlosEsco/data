    "en": "Homura Yuuya still can\u0026rsquo;t forget about an encounter he had over ten years ago. During the spring of his third year of middle school, in the rural countryside of Hokkaido, an art teacher by the name of Kiriaki Jun transferred to his school. With his flashy clothes and his frank personality, Kiriaki\u0026rsquo;s strangeness immediately caught Homura\u0026rsquo;s attention. After spending their days after school together in the art room, Homura begins to fall in love with Kiriaki. And one day, Homura asks Kiriaki if he will model for his painting. His desire, born from love, to spend more time together, brings about a tragedy that neither of them can imagine\u0026hellip; A collection of works from Matsuo Marta, who writes many diverse love stories."
